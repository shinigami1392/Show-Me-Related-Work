            "abstract" : "In this paper a practical case from an Austrian mechanical engineering company is presented. Simulation based manufacturing system improvement is applied to their component manufacturing plant. Based on the high number of items in the real case, a method for reduction of simulation model complexity applying item aggregation is developed in this paper. In the first improvement step, strategic capacity investment decisions are supported with the use of simulation. In the second step, a MRP planning parameter optimization is performed to improve service level and inventory. Additionally, the effect of capacity related decisions concerning setup time reduction and load-dependent outsourcing is evaluated. The results of this simulation study show that service level and inventory can be significantly improved by optimization of planning parameters and reduction of setup times. In addition, the study shows that load-dependent outsourcing is a viable alternative to capacity investment.",

            "abstract" : "The paper identifies prospective areas for electric drive control systems development and possibilities for their qualitative improvement. Application of the spectral method to the synthesis of electric drive control systems is under consideration. The wavelet spectrum processing capability estimation under the conditions of digital implementation of the controller and automatic control systems in general is given. It is proposed to use a system of basis functions different from the traditional one. Main requirements to basis functions are considered. The approach based on the integrated form of equations is proposed and its advantages for solution of the set problems are revealed. The conditions for the generating wavelet are stated and the possibility of numerical implementation based on the function of inverse wavelet transform is shown. It is illustrated that the dyadic wavelet transform of signals meets the basic requirements for basic functions systems. The suggested method guarantees that, in case of arbitrary increase of the rank members, the loss of the synthesis algorithm numerical stability would only be concerned with the peculiarities of the computer and the implementation of linear algebra algorithms.",

The CALS ideology proceeds from the assumption that information support facilitates implementation of modern and perspective projects anticipating their tangible embodiment. The basis of contemporary CALS technologies is formed by distributed automated systems which require unified data description and interpretation in the integrated system of various formats independent on the data acquisition place and the time. A common information space is formed in a way allowing miscellaneous studies and works performed in terms of the tasks being solved. The common information space was formed basing on computing power of the Educational resources information centre of the Institute of industrial engineering technologies within Nizhniy Novgorod state technical university n.a. R.E. Alekseev to implement the CALS concept in the project scope of the machine engineering cluster. This common information space accumulates information about the product, integrates automated systems and is formed in accordance with international, federal and industry-specific standards.",

Traditionally, the ME curriculum has relied on design courses, especially capstone design, to achieve these objectives. This brief paper will describe a new approach developed within a small public research universitys large (1,400+) undergraduate ME program in which faculty worked with the departments communications program director to embed technical communication instruction in at least four new required courses. The new curriculum combines applied learning and project-based learning methods in a series of four Mechanical Engineering Practice courses. Technical communication instruction is embedded in these courses via sixteen communication modules, enabling students to learn best practices in written, oral, and visual communication, apply those practices to their individual and team assignments, and receive formative feedback to improve future work. Preliminary feedback from students and departmental faculty has been positive; however, other programs interested in adopting such an approach will need to consider availability of grading resources and structure content to meet the unique needs of the student population and other constituents.",

In class students worked individually and in groups on several types of problems, participating also in a peer review activity. The pre-course content was consisted of existing material, videos, texts and appropriate URLs. This was delivered through a wiki on the wikispaces platform.

            "abstract" : "A deep water work class ROV (ROSUB 6000) rated for 6000 m subsea depth has been developed at National Institute of Ocean technology, Chennai, India. ROSUB 6000 system consists of a free swimming ROV, tether management system (TMS), power container, control console container, Launching and retrieval system (LARS) and electro optical umbilical cable. Developmental work of ROSUB 6000 system started from March 2003. During the developmental phase and several depth qualification sea trials various kinds of mechanical engineering challenges were encountered. This paper enumerates the challenges encountered. Water entry is one of the major challenges in subsea systems. Water entry through pressure housings may be catastrophic, since pressure housings carries control electronics. Control electronics switches off when water entry alarm is given stopping all the ROV operations. Water entry in the pressure cases of ROV has happened several times. Each instance the reason behind the water entry was different. Failure of components like torque arrester in TMS deep sea winch and thruster frames were analyzed and suitable methodologies to avoid these failures are brought into the practice. Challenges in deck handling of ROV and TMS are weather conditions and tether twist during initial attachment of ROV with TMS. One another big challenge is the launching and retrieval of the system. Challenges due to rough seas, launching and retrieval system hydraulic system faults, operational human errors and their effects on the system components are recorded and reviewed to improve the system reliability. The importance of buoyancy corrections and hydraulic system maintenance were learnt during the various phases of lab and field testing of the deep water ROV.",

In this case, engineering strain-stress curve of metals enumerating variation in its strength was used as the subject to be taught to mechanical engineering freshmen. The technical questionnaires, feedback forms and random interviews unveiled three significant things. First, analogy fostered interest and exposed students to creative form of learning. Second, mapping helped in the development of technical inventory. Finally the synergistic treatment of both techniques assisted freshmen to gain complete confidence to attempt any subject related technical query.",

Emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship, design thinking and creativity have been recently pulled together into the teaching and research on product design and development. However, the shear breadth of the topic means that there is no single way of teaching and doing research on it. The present paper looks into the similarities and differences across three very similar product development masters courses at three distinct Portuguese higher education institutions - Instituto Superior Tecnico (IST) of the University of Lisbon, Instituto Politecnico do Cavado e Ave (IPCA), and ISCTE business school (IBS) of Instituto Universitario de Lisboa. Product Development and Entrepreneurship is taught at IST mostly for students of mechanical engineering, whereas Advanced Product Development Methodologies is taught at IPCA mostly for industrial design students and New Product Development is taught at ISCTE for business students. All three courses use the same methodology of assessment and the same overall syllabus, with distributed assignments and expected outcomes. However, the nature and emphasis of specific aspects of the students projects are fundamentally different. The reasons for these differences are analyzed by the faculty involved, in the context of the students background and goals and examples are given. Conclusions and recommendations are provided at the end.",

            "abstract" : "Nowadays, an increasing number of video games enable third-party designers to redesign the original games. By adapting video games and taking advantage of their technical features such as 3D effects, audio, Internet communications, etc., educators can deliver certain course materials through these games. Meanwhile, whether, or to what extent, these educational adaptations enhance the students learning effectiveness is still the subject of research. In a mechanical engineering educational laboratory, students may face theories or concepts that they have just learned, mechanical devices that they have not previously used as well as collaborative tasks that they have not been assigned before. While traditional educational laboratories may be constrained by hardware, an adaptation of video games may help the students. An immersive gear train laboratory has been developed in which a popular first-person shooting game, Garrys Mod, was adapted. In this paper, an evaluation of this adaptation is presented from both a laboratory performance perspective and a learning effectiveness perspective. 110 undergraduate students who took the junior-level Machine Dynamics and Mechanisms course in the authors university performed video game-based gear train laboratory exercises immediately after attending the lectures and completing the homework related to the chapter on gear design. They were required to form groups for completing the laboratory tasks in the video game environment, where their operations were recorded. Short tests were given to the students before and after the laboratory exercises in order to assess whether their understanding of the course material was enhanced by the laboratory exercises. It was found that the students performance in the laboratory exercises is more likely to be affected by their understanding of the course material than by their familiarity with first-person shooting games. From these tests, it was observed that most students showed an improvement in understanding the course contents after completing the laboratory exercises.",

The access of the internet is easier day by day. My personal experience shows the young generation use smartphones, tablets to keep in contact with friends at home, on public transport, in the school etc. except sleeping. They use different communication forms like community sides, chat rooms and so on. These applications are protected by password authentication system to keep save the data of the users. I was interested for which systems find the mechanical engineering students important in everyday life and what kind of password use for protecting the information. Why is it important? We see almost in every month in the news a service provider was attacked again by hackers and the have put the username and the passwords on the Internet. The success of the attack depends on user error mainly. The companies store sometimes the important data without any protection. On the other hand the users share sensitive information on the community sites (&#x201C;I am going to a party today evening&#x201D;, &#x201C;I am on holiday by the see&#x201D; it means my home is empty tonight if I leave alone). I find the information security is a very important question today when we use lot of systems and we store the important information on devices, in cloud and so on. We have to know how can protect our information so I thought the basics of the information security in subject Informatics I. for the mechanical engineering students in the first semester because they do not have any subject which would include information about this topic. The students filled out an information security awareness questionnaire after the second semester. The multidimensional analysis shows which communication systems are more important to the students. These communications systems are protected by password authentication it means the next step of the analysis how long and how complicated password are used by students after the basic information security course in the first semester. The students had to say, how long password they are using by the most important systems like e-mail, community sites, and so on. The longer password is safer then shorter as we know. The following important question is how complicated is the used password. Is it include just lowercase letters, or include some uppercase letters too? Is it include maybe numbers or special characters like &#x201C;;&#x201D; or &#x201C;,&#x201D;? We need to know some more information about the used passwords. How often change the students these passwords? Are they using same passwords by different systems or one same password? In that case if they use same password it is more important to be the password complicated in other case if it is hacked, the attackers can log on in other systems too what the students use. After the analysis I could see how effective was the basic information security course for the mechanical engineering students. How could I build the information security awareness by them? Was it enough, or should I waste more time on this topic to help them to keep save the sensitive data?",

This causes high demands on the product development process, such as the need for a comprehensive understanding of the system and consideration of the full product lifecycle. Systems engineering (SE) is an approach that has the potential to fulfill these requirements. However, until now it could not be applied in a wide range of industries and segments, especially not in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper discusses different obstacles for the use of SE and presents a concept to enable target-oriented application of model-based systems engineering methods in SMEs. The paper reveals an example for the incremental implementation of model-based systems engineering in medium-sized enterprises in mechanical and plant engineering.

CPS are connected, embedded systems which directly record physical data using sensors and affect physical processes using actuators. They evaluate and save recorded data, use globally available services and interact with operators via multimodal human-machine-interfaces. In context of industrial production CPS change production processes radically. Due to the change of technical systems, equipment suppliers, especially companies of the mechanical engineering industry, face the challenges of a rising complexity and a nearly unmanageable amount of new solutions based on information and communication technology. The contribution at hand provides a reference architecture and maturity levels for CPS. The reference architecture serves as an universal blueprint to structure CPS and to visualize all components and relationships. Two sets of CPS maturity levels help companies to assess the status quo, to determine the target state and to define concrete actions for improving their systems.",

Of special interest to educators are the areas where the academic view is either contradictory to, or aligned with, the view of industry practitioners.

The problem is compounded when students are from different fields of engineering and have diverse backgrounds and skills. We describe a competition-based framework that has been integrated with rigorous labs to develop skills in core areas that are needed to complete a course capstone project successfully. Students learn the basics of mechatronics and, in the project, develop a mobile robot. The project varies from year to year. Our course is based on the low-cost Arduino platform. This paper briefly discusses pedagogical strategies and tools that have been used at other schools, and then focuses on describing the lecture, laboratory, and project components of our course. The results are encouraging and indicate that our course structure provides an effective means for learning mechatronics.",

            "abstract" : "This paper is inspired by the Keynote Speech which I gave at ITHET 2014 in York in September 2014. The material was very well received, and it seemed appropriate to offer it for publication in the proceedings of ITHET 2015. In preparing this Keynote Speech I was reminded of the &#x201C;Spectral Lines&#x201D; article by Donald Christiansen. He was a famous editor of IEEE Spectrum. The article was entitled &#x201C;Do students really get it?&#x201D; The 80:20 Rule: What he was really referring to was the difficulty many students in engineering have in grasping difficult threshold subjects. Some estimates suggest that the 80:20 rule applies. 20% get it, and 80% muddle through. What should we be doing about it? Does it really matter?: We still manage to produce enough technically competent engineers to push our society forward (or do we?) Can we really improve that 80:20 rule to perhaps 50:50? Is it our responsibility as educators to be doing that? Is it not perhaps the students who should be taking the responsibility for their own learning. In this paper I am going to explore how we can perhaps do it by changing our teaching style.",

However, the use of the flipped classroom has received less attention in engineering subjects and currently only limited research exists. The purpose of this study is to identify empirical studies that have investigated the impact of using a flipped classroom model in undergraduate engineering education. The search for empirical articles included electronic databases for engineering education such as IEEExplore, Inspec and ERIC. The following keywords were used during this search: flipped classroom, engineering education. A total of 24 studies were included in the review. Most studies reported high student satisfaction and increased performance in a flipped classroom environment.",

Those environment factors that can be controlled in the current implementation include gravity (both magnitude and direction), surface friction, and atmospheric drag. The coefficients of restitution of elastic bodies can also be altered. Trajectories of objects can be traced to facilitate measurements. The laboratory allows students to measure both displacements and elapsed time. Time may be frozen to allow for precise observation of time-varying phenomena. This laboratory will ultimately be extended into the macroscopic and microscopic domains -giving students access to direct observations that were heretofore impossible. This new application of computer graphics in education has the potential to augment or replace traditional laboratory instruction with approaches that offer superior motivation, retention, and intellectual stimulation.",

            "abstract" : "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general-purpose computing. Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today&#x02019;s computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today&#x02019;s abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.",

In this scenario, classification approaches are useful to understand differences and identify opportunities of generalization and common solutions, especially when different disciplines are coming together and bringing their individual terms and concepts. We propose a novel model for classifying Smart Objects using capabilities. This five-level model, inspired in the Capability Maturity Models, aims to be simple and inclusive, separating objects with basic capabilities from those with complex ones. In addition, examples of objects for each level are provided as validation of the proposal. The model is useful to identify requirements that Smart Objects have to cover externally as they cannot themselves support them and thus it allows for clear understanding of the external support system (or Middleware) into which the smart object is embedded.",

            "abstract" : "Assessment in the context of education is the process of characterizing what a student knows. The reasons to perform assessment are quite varied, ranging from a need to informally understand student learning progress in a course to a need to characterize student expertise in a subject. Finding an appropriate assessment tool is a central challenge in designing an assessment approach. The focus of this paper is on the use of concept maps for both course-level and program-level assessment in engineering education. Concept maps, which are node and arc representations of the relationships among concepts, provide one means to represent student knowledge. This paper presents background on concept maps and describes uses of concept maps at both the course and program level.",

Based on BOM and routing information a simulation model is generated to analyze a shop floor structure. Different modules are used for generating customer orders and production orders and handling the material flow until the customer is satisfied. The basic idea is that the modules are not connected directly together but the material flow is routed according the information defined in BOM and routing. The model can apply stochastic behavior for processing times, set up times, purchasing lead time, customer required lead time, customer required amount and segmentation from product group to final product. Conwip and MRPII including MPS are implemented as production planning and control methods. The simulation model can be used for analyzing complex production system structures to evaluate the logistical performance.",

            "abstract" : "Navigation speed for most navigation interfaces is still determined by rate-control devices (e.g. joystick). The interface designer is in charge of adjusting the range of optimal speeds according to the scale of the environment and the desired user experience. However, this approach is not valid for complex environments (e.g. multi-scale environments). Optimal speeds might vary for each section of the environment, leading to non-desired side effects such as collisions or simulator sickness. Thereby, we propose a speedadaptation algorithm based on the spatial relationship between the user and the environment and the users perception of motion. The computed information is used to adjust the navigation speed in order to provide an optimal navigation speed and avoid collisions. Two main benefits of our approach is firstly, the ability to adapt the navigation speed in multi-scale environments and secondly, the capacity to provide a smooth navigation experience by decreasing the jerkiness of described trajectories. The evaluation showed that our approach provides comparable performance as existing navigation techniques but it significantly decreases the jerkiness of described trajectories.",

This study reviewed the few studies with sufficient information available to determine the effect that exposure duration and repeated exposure have on motion sickness. This evaluation confirmed that longer exposures produce more symptoms and that total sickness subsides over repeated exposures. Additional evaluation was performed to investigate the precise form of this relationship and to determine whether the same form was generalizable across varied simulator environments. The results indicated that exposure duration and repeated exposures are significantly linearly related to sickness outcomes (duration being positively related and repetition negatively related to total sickness). This was true over diverse systems and large subject pools. This result verified the generalizability of the relationships among sickness, exposure duration, and repeated exposures. Additional research is indicated to determine the optimal length of a single exposure and the optimal intersession interval to facilitate adaptation.",

A real-time cybersickness detection system was constructed with an artificial neural network whose inputs were the electrophysiological signals of subjects in a virtual environment. The system was equipped with a means of feedback; it temporarily provided a narrow field of view and a message about navigation speed deceleration, both of which acted as feedback outputs whenever electrophysiological inputs signaled the occurrence of cybersickness. This system is named cybersickness relief virtual environment (CRVE). Forty-seven subjects experienced the VR for 9.5 min twice in CRVE and non-CRVE conditions. The results indicated that the frequency of cybersickness and simulator sickness questionnaire scores were lower in the CRVE condition than in the non-CRVE condition. Subjects also showed a higher net increase in tachyarrhythmia from the baseline period to the virtual navigation period in the CRVE condition compared to the non-CRVE condition. These results suggest that a CRVE condition may be a countermeasure against cybersickness.",

The NAVE has three 8 feet by 6 feet screens. The two side screens are positioned at 120 degree angles to the central screen to give a three-sided display area that is sixteen feet wide and approximately seven feet deep. This allows for two different field of view configurations, a one-screen set-up that provides a 60 degree FOV, and a three-screen set-up that provides a 180 degree FOV. Users are seated in front of the center screen and navigate with a joystick. The virtual environment used in this study could be displayed in the NAVE stereo-visually or in mono, providing us with a second experimental factor, display fidelity. Lastly, we were interested in determining whether or not the users role in the environment would affect their experience of simulator sickness and presence as suggested by Stanney and Kennedy (1997). This provided us with our third factor user role, with its two levels, driver and passenger.",

In contrast to previous redirection techniques, this approach, based on a dynamic environment model, does not introduce any visual-vestibular conflicts from manipulating the mapping between physical and virtual motions, nor does it require breaking presence to stop and explicitly reorient the user. We conducted two user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the change blindness illusion when exploring a virtual environment that was an order of magnitude larger than the physical walking space. Despite the dynamically changing environment, participants were able to draw coherent sketch maps of the environment structure, and pointing task results indicated that they were able to maintain their spatial orientation within the virtual world. Only one out of 77 participants across both both studies definitively noticed that a scene change had occurred, suggesting that change blindness redirection provides a remarkably compelling illusion. Secondary findings revealed that a wide field-of-view increases pointing accuracy and that experienced gamers reported greater sense of presence than those with little or no experience with 3D video games.",

            "abstract" : "The effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) has often been linked to the sense of presence reported by users of those VEs. (<italic>Presence</italic> is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of <italic>Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments.</italic> We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: <list list-type=arabic> <list-item><p>the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability;</list-item> <list-item><p>there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs;</list-item> <list-item><p>individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and</list-item> <list-item><p>[individuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.</list-item></list>.",

The results of this survey are compared to observations made by engineers during in depth interviews (see ibid., March 1995). In both studies, engineers report that communication is a central activity that consumes fully half of the working day. Based on both the survey and interview data, the authors recommend adjusting curricula to include the practice of cooperative problem-solving, to make evaluation of communication competence a component of grades, and to require students to take both a technical writing and public presentation course.",

The curriculum was designed to prepare students for the senior capstone design project, in which they design and build a working mechatronic/robotic system. It consists of a basic program in mechanical engineering, augmented with courses and laboratories in electronics, microprocessors, control, and computer programming. The early introduction of the specialty courses and the ample hands-on experience offered in the accompanying laboratories allows students to gain intuitive understanding of concepts that are usually foreign to mechanical engineers. The capstone design project attracts students to the program and serves as a beacon for the entire program. The program is now in its 11th year, receiving positive feedback from students and graduates.",

The model combines different perception methods such as reading, listening, and speaking and practice methods developed in accordance with the vocational background of students enrolled in the course Electromechanical Systems in mechatronics education. For this purpose, the effectiveness of the model recommended for mechatronics education was investigated on a working group consisting of 32 sophomore students in the 2008-2009 Spring semester in the Mechatronics Department of the Faculty of Technical Education, Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey. The 12-week-long Electromechanical Systems course is given each semester and covers the topics of mechatronics, electric principles, electrostatics, magnetism and principles, control components, control and power circuits, industrial electronics, and direct and alternating current motors. The text, pictures, and images for the Web-supported education materials used in the study were developed using Adobe Presenter and Adobe Captivate software. In addition, Adobe Flash was used to provide the interactivity between the students and the training content, and 3dsMax software was used for 3-D simulations. Finally, Adobe Connect Professional software was used as a learning management system. During this process, expert opinion in the field of educational sciences, instructional technologies, and electromechanical systems was consulted. The efficiency of the model recommended for mechatronics education was evaluated by using data collection forms and the results of interviews with the students.",

            "abstract" : "An interdisciplinary undergraduate-level robotics course offers students the chance to integrate their engineering knowledge learned throughout their college years by building a robotic system. Robotics is thus a core course in system and control-related engineering education. This paper summarizes the experience of developing robotics courses presented in the literature and shares the authors experiences through many years of teaching and developing robotics courses with other educators in the Department of Mechatronics, Chungnam National University (CNU), Daejeon, Korea. First, the CNU robotics course described here has classroom and laboratory sections. In class, students learn the theories behind robotics and practice them by performing simulation studies. In parallel, students perform robotics exercises in the laboratory. Second, the lab exercises are focused on hands-on experiments on robot systems; these include an experimental kit, LEGO robots, humanoid robots, industrial robots, and home service robots. Third, competition-based learning is explored by assigning a class project to develop a boxing robot, which covers both manipulation and mobility. Finally, the course introduces robotics-associated outreach activities. The analysis of several years of student evaluation is presented.",

MATLAB was used as a control and visualization environment, while the Arduino board was utilized as a final controller for the servo motors as well as a Data Acquisition Card (DAC). However, it is important to recognize that there is much more knowledge to learn to control a robot, such as hardware (sensors, actuators) knowledge, software knowledge and control theory. But, it is important to emphasize that this paper is merely focused on the hardware and software development which can be utilized to accomplish many tasks like controlling the walking motion. Here the platform set up and the algorithm adopted in controlling the servos as well as reading from the sensors are described such that any student can reconstruct and start using it to understand his/her subject.",

This paper describes how design competitions have been integrated into mechatronics education at Georgia Tech. Three types of competitions are described. The first contests are used in the introductory mechanical design course. The course requires the students to work in teams to create a mechatronics device, so the course can also be considered an introductory mechatronics course. The second type of competitions are used in a graduate-level controls implementation course. Finally, an extracurricular contest that requires the students to build an autonomous &#x201C;satellite&#x201D; is described.",

Building a successful micromouse involves the design and construction of the hardware, control, sensor and system integration, microcontroller integration, and development of computer algorithms for mapping and route planning. Beyond the technical skills, team members also learn team work, time management, and communication skills. Micromouse gives students the ability to learn these valuable skills and, more importantly, gain some experience, thus giving them an edge in a very competitive job market. With the motivation we have gained as winners of the IEEE NW Area Micromouse Competition for the past four years in a row, in this paper we aim to describe the important technical aspects and the required continuous improvements to the system in terms of design, controls, and computer algorithms for a better, faster autonomous robot We also show how a micromouse program can be beneficial, especially for undergraduate research and education in robotics and mechatronics.",

This study compared the effectiveness of an inverted classroom to a traditional classroom in three areas: 1) content coverage; 2) student performance on traditional quizzes and exam problems; and 3) student observations and perception of the inverted classroom format. A control-treatment experiment comparing an inverted classroom to a traditional lecture-style format was used. The results show that: 1) the inverted classroom allowed the instructor to cover more material; 2) students participating in the inverted classroom performed as well or better on comparable quiz and exam questions and on open-ended design problems; and 3) while students initially struggled with the new format, they adapted quickly and found the inverted classroom format to be satisfactory and effective.",

Flipping classrooms involve students in using their textbooks, online materials, and other useful resources before coming to class. Consequently, students can spend valuable class meetings on problem-solving activities instead of lectures. Positive feedback from utilizing the flipped classroom techniques has been reported in several papers. This article presents an attempt to implement the flipped classroom for a large introductory engineering class in multivariable calculus at King Mongkuts Institute of Technology Ladkrabang. The results from implementing the flipped classroom both quantitatively and qualitatively showed a higher performance and more positive feedback when compared to those obtained from this class taught by the same instructor using the traditional classroom format in the previous year.",

            "abstract" : "An alternative to the traditional classroom structure that has seen increased use in higher education is the flipped classroom. Flipping the classroom switches when assignments (e.g. homework) and knowledge transfer (e.g. lecture) occur. Flipped classrooms are getting popular in secondary and post-secondary teaching institutions as evidenced by the marked increase in the study, use, and application of the flipped pedagogy as it applies to learning and retention. The majority of the courses that have undergone this change use applied learning strategies and include a significant &#x201C;learning-by-doing&#x201D; component. The research in this area is skewed towards such courses and in general there are many considerations that educators ought to account for if they were to move to this form of teaching. Introductory courses in computer programming can appear to have all the elements needed to move to a flipped environment; however, initial observations from our research identify possible pitfalls with the assumption. In this work in progress the authors discuss early results and observations of implementing a flipped classroom to teach an introductory programming course (CS1) to engineering, engineering technology, and software engineering undergraduates.",

Students were asked to watch online lectures and then come to class prepared to work problems in small groups of four. The attitude, retention, and performance of students in the flipped group in Spring 2013 were compared to those for the traditionally taught group in Fall 2012. The Fall 2012 lectures were recorded, so that each group saw the same lectures. Student retention and test performance was significantly higher in the flipped course. In Fall 2012, 56% of the initially enrolled students received a C or better. In Spring 2013, this improved to 83%. The first exam scores were significantly better in Spring 2013, and this helped with student success. The authors believe that it was the alignment of online lectures, face-to-face student/teacher and peer/peer interactions, combined with the active learning component of the flipped classroom that led to these improvements .",

            "abstract" : "The conventional approach to university education, prevalent for hundreds of years, involves a lecture by the professor during the scheduled class period and students working on exercises outside of class. Flipping a classroom refers to reversing the traditional role of in- and out-of-class activities. This instructional approach is sometimes also called inverting a classroom. In a flipped paradigm, the students are introduced to topics and basic concepts using video lectures or other means during their time outside of the classroom and spend the scheduled class period working on exercises under the supervision of the instructor. Instead of being a sage on the stage the instructor now becomes a guide on the side [1]. The conventional paradigm treats the student as an empty container into which knowledge is poured, while the flipped paradigm treats the student as an active learner who reconstructs knowledge from information. The flipped classroom began to receive increasing attention in the early 2000s (e.g., [2] and [3]) and has become much more accessible to instructors recently with the advent of low-cost screencasting software, e.g., [4], and Web-based course and video management tools. My institution, the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison), recently opened a new teaching facility in 2011 called WisCEL [5] that is specifically designed for interactive, student-centered approaches to teaching and is perfectly suited for the flipped classroom format.",

The SS-capture system records Screenshots as a series of still images synchronously with input from a microphone. The resultant recording is akin to a slide show and can be readily distributed and viewed on-line using a web server and browser respectively. The SS-capture system removes barriers that ordinarily inhibit average teachers in faculties of engineering, who often lack a background in educational technology, from implementing a flipped classroom. Although the SS-capture system requires students to exert more effort than in a traditional lecture-based classroom, they nevertheless gave it high praise since it allowed them to learn at their own pace. The benefits of flipped classrooms include increased learning time, proactive student participation/interaction, a subjective understanding of course content, and a substantial rise in academic performance.",

            "abstract" : "The need to serve increasingly diverse learning communities requires a curriculum that not only recognizes alternative modes of thinking but also helps students develop the complex thinking skills required by industry. Classroom inversion or &#x201C;flipping&#x201D; can provide a useful framework for this new paradigm by pre-engaging students with the material. The classroom lecture can then be replaced with collaborative problem solving exercises or model eliciting activities. While the most common methods used for pre-engagement include streamed lectures or podcasts, these techniques are subject to some of the same concerns associated with passive lectures or assigned readings. In this paper we present an approach for classroom inversion that is based on three premises: pre-engagement occurs through online interactive modules, classroom lectures are replaced with group problem solving activities, and homework assignments incorporate open ended problems or model eliciting activities. Examples of online interactive modules in accounting and cost estimating are presented. We follow with a discussion of the resultant transformation of the classroom learning environment along with some samples incorporating open-ended problem solving exercises. Preliminary assessments indicating gains in student learning along with future directions and implications for a broader approach to innovation and entrepreneurship is discussed.",

            "abstract" : "Feasibility analysis of fixed priority systems has been widely studied in the real-time literature and several acceptance tests have been proposed to guarantee a set of periodic tasks. They can be divided in two main classes: polynomial time tests and exact tests. Polynomial time tests can efficiently be used for online guarantee of real-time applications, where tasks are activated at runtime. These tests introduce a negligible overhead, when executed upon a new task arrival, however provide only a sufficient schedulability condition, which may cause a poor processor utilization. On the other hand, exact tests, which are based on response time analysis, provide a necessary and sufficient schedulability condition, but are too complex to be executed on line for large task sets. As a consequence, for large task sets, they are often executed off line. This paper proposes a novel approach for analyzing the schedulability of periodic task sets on a single processor under an arbitrary fixed priority assignment: Using this approach, we derive a new schedulability test which can be tuned through a parameter to balance complexity versus acceptance ratio, so that it can be used on line to better exploit the processor, based on the available computational power. Extensive simulations show that our test, when used in its exact form, is significantly faster than the current response time analysis methods. Moreover the proposed approach, for its elegance and compactness, offers an explanation of some known phenomena of fixed priority scheduling and could be helpful for further work on schedulability analysis.",

            "abstract" : "Giotto provides an abstract programmers model for the implementation of embedded control systems with hard real-time constraints. A typical control application consists of periodic software tasks together with a mode-switching logic for enabling and disabling tasks. Giotto specifies time-triggered sensor readings, task invocations, actuator updates, and mode switches independent of any implementation platform. Giotto can be annotated with platform constraints such as task-to-host mappings, and task and communication schedules. The annotations are directives for the Giotto compiler, but they do not alter the functionality and timing of a Giotto program. By separating the platform-independent from the platform-dependent concerns, Giotto enables a great deal of flexibility in choosing control platforms as well as a great deal of automation in the validation and synthesis of control software. The time-triggered nature of Giotto achieves timing predictability, which makes Giotto particularly suitable for safety-critical applications.",

            "abstract" : "We present an assume-guarantee interface algebra for real-time components. In our formalism a component implements a set of task sequences that share a resource. A component interface consists of an arrival rate function and a latency for each task sequence, and a capacity function for the shared resource. The interface specifies that the component guarantees certain task latencies depending on assumptions about task arrival rates and allocated resource capacities. Our algebra defines compatibility and refinement relations on interfaces. Interface compatibility can be checked on partial designs, even when some component interfaces are yet unknown. In this case interface composition computes as new assumptions the weakest constraints on the unknown components that are necessary to satisfy the specified guarantees. Interface refinement is defined in a way that ensures that compatible interfaces can be refined and implemented independently. Our algebra thus formalizes an interface-based design methodology that supports both the incremental addition of new components and the independent stepwise refinement of existing components. We demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of the framework through simulation experiments.",

The emphasis of this article is on switched, highly loaded networks, where unpredictable delays introduce excessive synchronization noise. PC clocks are accurate enough when connected within a network, but a new requirement is for them to be synchronized, which means that they should show the same time at the same instant. The most prominent time-synchronization method is the network time protocol proposed by Mills and Internet engineering task force group. A complete solution of the high-precision time-synchronization problem must reduce the randomness associated with the RTOS. The methods discussed in this article can help determine the frequency and time offset of a local time-of-day clock. The next challenge is to construct a local time-of-day clock and apply the synchronization information to it.",

Nondeterminism should be judiciously and carefully introduced where needed, and it should be explicit in programs. In general-purpose software engineering practice, we have reached a point where one approach to concurrent programming dominates all others namely, threads, sequential processes that share memory. They represent a key concurrency model supported by modern computers, programming languages, and operating systems. In scientific computing, where performance requirements have long demanded concurrent programming, data-parallel language extensions and message-passing libraries such as PVM, MPI, and OpenMP dominate over threads for concurrent programming. Computer architectures intended for scientific computing often differ significantly from so-called general-purpose architectures.",

            "abstract" : "Programmable processors specialized to intensive numerical computation and real-time signal processing are often deeply pipelined. The ensuing gain in throughput is moderated by the difficulty of efficiently programming such processors. Techniques for overcoming this difficulty are effective only for modest amounts of pipelining. This paper proposes applying an old but rarely used architectural approach to the design of single-chip signal processors so that the potential benefits of extensive pipelining can be fully realized. The architectural approach is to interleave multiple processes (or programs) through a single deeply pipelined processor in such a way that the disadvantages of deep pipelining disappear. Instead, the user is faced with the need to construct programs that can execute as concurrent processes. The main advantage is that much more pipelining can be used without aggravating the programming. A specific experimental architecture is outlined. The solution offered is a system solution in that architectural performance is considered along with programmability and ease of use. In the companion paper, data flow programming is suggested so that algorithms can be automatically partitioned for concurrent execution. Data flow provides a natural environment in which to build signal processing programs and can be supported efficiently in an architecture of the type described here.",

Such computers wed physical systems to software, tightly integrating the two and generating complex component interactions unknown in earlier systems. Thus, it is imperative that we construct software and its associated physical system so they can evolve together. The paper discusses one approach that accomplishes this called model-integrated computing. This works by extending the scope and use of models. It starts by defining the computational processes that a system must perform and develops models that become the backbone for the development of computer-based systems. In this approach, integrated, multiple-view models capture information relevant to the system under design. The paper considers the Multigraph Architecture framework for model-integrated computing developed at Vanderbilts Measurement and Computing Systems Laboratory.",

            "abstract" : "Discrete-event (DE) models are formal system specifications that have analysable deterministic behaviors. Using a global, consistent notion of time, DE components communicate via time-stamped events. DE models have primarily been used in performance modeling and simulation, where time stamps are a modeling property bearing no relationship to real time during execution of the model. In this paper, we extend DE models with the capability of relating certain events to physical time. We propose a programming model, called PTIDES (programming temporally integrated distributed embedded systems), which has DE semantics, but with carefully chosen relations between model time and real time. Key to making this model effective is to ensure that constraints that guarantee determinacy in the semantics are preserved at runtime. To accomplish this, we give a distributed execution strategy that obeys DE semantics without the penalty of totally ordered executions based on time stamps. Our technique relies on having a distributed common notion of time, known to some precision. Based on causality analysis of DE models, we define relevant dependency and relevant orders to enable out-of-order execution without compromising determinism and without requiring backtracking",

In this way, the specification for an intelligent product is being built - one whose information content is permanently bound to its material content. This paper explores the impact of such development on supply chains, contrasting between simple and complex product supply chains. The Auto-ID project is on track to enable such connectivity between products and information using a single, open-standard, data repository for storage and retrieval of product information. The potential impact on the design and management of supply chains is immense. This paper provides an introduction to of some of these changes, demonstrating that by enabling intelligent products, Auto ID systems will be instrumental in driving future supply chains. The paper also identifies specific application areas for this technology in the product supply chain.",

More recently, one can observe a flourish of proposals aimed at giving social-like capabilities to the objects in the Internet of Things. Such proposals address the design of conceptual (and software) platforms, which can be exploited to easily develop and implement complex applications that require direct interactions among objects. The major goal is to build techniques that allow the network to enhance the level of trust between objects that are friends with each other. Furthermore, a social paradigm could definitely guarantee network navigability even if the number of nodes becomes orders of magnitude higher than in the traditional Internet.

The database used to automatically generate and drive the simulation model is a copy of the production planning database. A set of proof-of-concept tools and a database have been generated to verify the method and it has been shown that it is feasible to run a simulation using the production planning data as the only information source. The software developed is modular and designed to work in heterogeneous environments. The method is expected to reduce the modeling and maintenance effort considerably when modeling entire factories. The method will result in a holistic and fairly accurate assessment of performance measures for an entire factory.",

            "title" : "Kinematic Evaluation of Virtual Walking Trajectories",
            "abstract" : "Virtual walking, a fundamental task in Virtual Reality (VR), is greatly influenced by the locomotion interface being used, by the specificities of input and output devices, and by the way the virtual environment is represented. No matter how virtual walking is controlled, the generation of realistic virtual trajectories is absolutely required for some applications, especially those dedicated to the study of walking behaviors in VR, navigation through virtual places for architecture, rehabilitation and training. Previous studies focused on evaluating the realism of locomotion trajectories have mostly considered the result of the locomotion task (efficiency, accuracy) and its subjective perception (presence, cybersickness). Few focused on the locomotion trajectory itself, but in situation of geometrically constrained task. In this paper, we study the realism of unconstrained trajectories produced during virtual walking by addressing the following question: did the user reach his destination by virtually walking along a trajectory he would have followed in similar real conditions? To this end, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework consisting on a set of trajectographical criteria and a locomotion model to generate reference trajectories. We consider a simple locomotion task where users walk between two oriented points in space. The travel path is analyzed both geometrically and temporally in comparison to simulated reference trajectories. In addition, we demonstrate the framework over a user study which considered an initial set of common and frequent virtual walking conditions, namely different input devices, output display devices, control laws, and visualization modalities. The study provides insight into the relative contributions of each condition to the overall realism of the resulting virtual trajectories.",

Whereas many previous interfaces preserve or stimulate the users proprioception, the Joyman aims at preserving equilibrioception in order to improve the feeling of immersion during virtual locomotion tasks. The proposed interface is based on the metaphor of a human-scale joystick. The device has a simple mechanical design that allows a user to indicate his virtual navigation intentions by leaning accordingly. We also propose a control law inspired by the biomechanics of the human locomotion to transform the measured leaning angle into a walking direction and speed - i.e., a virtual velocity vector. A preliminary evaluation was conducted in order to evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of the proposed interface and to better draw the future expectations of such a device.",

Sensory conflict theories predict that cybersickness produced by a VE is a kind of visually induced motion sickness. A comprehensive review indicates that there is only one subjective measure to quantify visual stimuli presented inside a VE. A metric, referred to as <italic>spatial velocity</italic> (SV), is proposed. It combines objective measures of scene complexity and scene movement velocity. The theoretical basis for the proposed SV metric and the algorithms for its implementation are presented. Data from two previous experiments on cybersickness were reanalyzed using the metric. Results showed that increasing SV by either increasing the scene complexity or scene velocity significantly increased the rated level of cybersickness. A strong correlation between SV and the level of cybersickness was found. The use of the spatial velocity metric to predict levels of cybersickness is also discussed.",

Wide FOVs provide a more immersive environment and produce stronger self-motion perception. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships between FOV and scene content on postural stability in an immersive environment. 10 subjects were tested using two different scenes (a simple radial pattern and a meaningful city scene) at six FOVs (30/spl deg/, 60/spl deg/, 90/spl deg/, 120/spl deg/, 150/spl deg/ 180/spl deg/) using a within-subjects design. Subjects exhibited more postural disturbance with increasing FOV. A surprisingly large increase in disturbance was found for the interval between 150/spl deg/ and 180/spl deg/ using the city scene. No statistically significant difference was found for effects of scene content. Two groups (postural stable group and postural unstable group) were identified during experiment. These groups performed differently in the two scene conditions. Future research plans are described.",

            "abstract" : "A between-group experiment was carried out to assess whether two different presence questionnaires can distinguish between real and virtual experiences. One group of ten subjects searched for a box in a real office environment. A second group of ten subjects carried out the same task in a virtual environment that simulated the same office. Immediately after their experience, subjects were given two different presence questionnaires in randomized order: the Witmer and Singer Presence (WS), and the questionnaire developed by Slater, Usoh, and Steed (SUS). The paper argues that questionnaires should be able to pass a &#8220;reality test&#8221; whereby under current conditions the presence scores should be higher for real experiences than for virtual ones. Nevertheless, only the SUS had a marginally higher mean score for the real compared to the virtual, and there was no significant difference at all between the WS mean scores. It is concluded that, although such questionnaires may be useful when all subjects experience the same type of environment, their utility is doubtful for the comparison of experiences across environments, such as immersive virtual compared to real, or desktop compared to immersive virtual.",

Understanding how people form cognitive maps of virtual environments is vital to effective virtual world design. Unfortunately, such an understanding is hampered by the difficulty of cognitive map measurement. The present study tests the validity of using sketch maps to examine aspects of virtual world cognitive maps. We predict that subjects who report feeling oriented within the virtual world will produce better sketch maps and so sketch-map accuracy can be used as an external measure of subject orientation and world knowledge. Results show a high positive correlation between subjective ratings of orientation, world knowledge and sketch-map accuracy, supporting our hypothesis that sketch maps provide a valid measure of internal cognitive maps of virtual environments. Results across different worlds also suggest that sketch maps can be used to find an absolute measure for goodness of world design.",

To overcome the limited interaction space in small VR laboratory setups, we have implemented redirected walking techniques to support natural exploration of comparably large-scale virtual models.

            "abstract" : "When an immersive virtual environment represents a space that is larger than the available space within which a user can travel by directly walking, it becomes necessary to consider alternative methods for traveling through that space. The traditional solution is to require the user to travel indirectly, using a device that changes his viewpoint in the environment without actually requiring him to move - for example, a joystick. However, other solutions involving variations on direct walking are also possible. In this paper, we present a new metaphor for natural, augmented direct locomotion through moderately large-scale immersive virtual environments (IVEs) presented via head mounted display systems, which we call seven league boots. The key characteristic of this method is that it involves determining a users intended direction of travel and then augmenting only the component of his or her motion that is aligned with that direction. After reviewing previously proposed methods for enabling intuitive locomotion through large IVEs, we begin by describing the technical implementation details of our novel method, discussing the various alternative options that we explored and parameters that we varied in an attempt to attain optimal performance. We then present the results of a pilot observer experiment that we conducted in an attempt to obtain objective, qualitative insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses of our new method, in comparison to the three most commonly used alternative locomotion methods: flying, via use of a wand; normal walking, with a uniform gain applied to the output of the tracker; and normal walking without gain, but with the location and orientation of the larger virtual environment periodically adjusted relative to position of the participant in the real environment. In this study we found, among other things, that for travel down a long, straight virtual hallway, participants overwhelmingly preferred the seven league boots method to the other methods, overall",

Techniques proposed to lift this size constraint, enabling real walking in VEs that are larger than the tracked lab space, all require reorientation techniques (ROTs) in the worst-case situation-when a user is close to walking out of the tracked space. We propose a new ROT using visual and audial distractors-objects in the VE that the user focuses on while the VE rotates-and compare our method to current ROTs through three user studies. ROTs using distractors were preferred and ranked more natural by users. Our findings also suggest that improving visual realism and adding sound increased a users feeling of presence. Users were also less aware of the rotating VE when ROTs with distractors were used.",

Our new locomotion interface, Improved Redirection with Distractors (IRD), enables users to walk in larger-than-tracked space VEs without predefined waypoints. We compared IRD to the current best interface, really walking, by conducting a user study measuring navigational ability. Our results show that IRD users can really walk through VEs that are larger than the tracked space and can point to targets and complete maps of VEs no worse than when really walking.",

            "abstract" : "In visual perception, change blindness describes the phenomenon that persons viewing a visual scene may apparently fail to detect significant changes in that scene. These phenomena have been observed in both computer generated imagery and real-world scenes. Several studies have demonstrated that change blindness effects occur primarily during visual disruptions such as blinks or saccadic eye movements. However, until now the influence of stereoscopic vision on change blindness has not been studied thoroughly in the context of visual perception research. In this paper we introduce change blindness techniques for stereoscopic projection systems, providing the ability to substantially modify a virtual scene in a manner that is difficult for observers to perceive. We evaluate techniques for passive and active stereoscopic viewing and compare the results to those of monoscopic viewing conditions. For stereoscopic viewing conditions, we found that change blindness phenomena occur with the same magnitude as in monoscopic viewing conditions. Furthermore, we have evaluated the potential of the presented techniques for allowing abrupt, and yet significant, changes of a stereoscopically displayed virtual reality environment.",

            "abstract" : "In immersive virtual environments (IVEs), users can control their virtual viewpoint by moving their tracked head and walking through the real world. Usually, movements in the real world are mapped one-to-one to virtual camera motions. With redirection techniques, the virtual camera is manipulated by applying gains to user motion so that the virtual world moves differently than the real world. Thus, users can walk through large-scale IVEs while physically remaining in a reasonably small workspace. In psychophysical experiments with a two-alternative forced-choice task, we have quantified how much humans can unknowingly be redirected on physical paths that are different from the visually perceived paths. We tested 12 subjects in three different experiments: (E1) discrimination between virtual and physical rotations, (E2) discrimination between virtual and physical straightforward movements, and (E3) discrimination of path curvature. In experiment E1, subjects performed rotations with different gains, and then had to choose whether the visually perceived rotation was smaller or greater than the physical rotation. In experiment E2, subjects chose whether the physical walk was shorter or longer than the visually perceived scaled travel distance. In experiment E3, subjects estimate the path curvature when walking a curved path in the real world while the visual display shows a straight path in the virtual world. Our results show that users can be turned physically about 49 percent more or 20 percent less than the perceived virtual rotation, distances can be downscaled by 14 percent and upscaled by 26 percent, and users can be redirected on a circular arc with a radius greater than 22 m while they believe that they are walking straight.",

            "abstract" : "We report a user study which compared four virtual environment travel techniques using a divided attention task. Participants used either real walking, gaze-directed, pointing-directed, or torso-directed travel to follow a target through an environment while simultaneously responding to auditory stimuli. In addition to travel technique, we investigated gender as a between-subjects variable and task difficulty (simple or complex) and task type (single or divided) as within-subjects variables. Real walking allowed superior performance over the pointing-directed technique on measures of navigation task performance and recognition of stimuli presented during navigation. This indicates that participants using real walking may have had more spare cognitive capacity to process and encode stimuli than those using pointing-directed travel. We also found a gender-difficulty interaction where males performed worse and responded slower to the attention task when the spatial task was more difficult, but no differences were observed for females between difficulty levels. While these results may be pertinent for the design of virtual environments, the nature and goal of the virtual environment tasks must be carefully considered to determine whether similar effects on performance can be expected under different conditions.",

            "abstract" : "We report a series of experiments conducted to investigate the effects of travel technique on information gathering and cognition in complex virtual environments. In the first experiment, participants completed a non-branching multilevel 3D maze at their own pace using either real walking or one of two virtual travel techniques. In the second experiment, we constructed a real-world maze with branching pathways and modeled an identical virtual environment. Participants explored either the real or virtual maze for a predetermined amount of time using real walking or a virtual travel technique. Our results across experiments suggest that for complex environments requiring a large number of turns, virtual travel is an acceptable substitute for real walking if the goal of the application involves learning or reasoning based on information presented in the virtual world. However, for applications that require fast, efficient navigation or travel that closely resembles real-world behavior, real walking has advantages over common joystick-based virtual travel techniques.",

            "abstract" : "We describe a between-subjects experiment that compared four different methods of travel and their effect on cognition and paths taken in an immersive virtual environment (IVE). Participants answered a set of questions based on Crooks condensation of Blooms taxonomy that assessed their cognition of the IVE with respect to knowledge, understanding and application, and higher mental processes. Participants also drew a sketch map of the IVE and the objects within it. The users sense of presence was measured using the Steed-Usoh-Slater presence questionnaire. The participants position and head orientation were automatically logged during their exposure to the virtual environment. These logs were later used to create visualizations of the paths taken. Path analysis, such as exploring the overlaid path visualizations and dwell data information, revealed further differences among the travel techniques. Our results suggest that, for applications where problem solving and evaluation of information is important or where opportunity to train is minimal, then having a large tracked space so that the participant can walk around the virtual environment provides benefits over common virtual travel techniques.",

            "abstract" : "This paper describes a preliminary investigation of bibliographic citation practices in the field of computing, based on linguistic and rhetorical analyses of 1,255 citations in 36 academic papers from four representative journals in the field: IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, and the IEEE Transactions on Computers. Rhetorical functions of the citations are identified, along with representative examples of the language that is used to achieve the rhetorical goals. The data is then discussed in light of current bibliographic citation instruction, and recommendations are made for developing better training for novices and nonnative speakers of English who need more specific than is normally available.",

One successful part of this education at ETHZ is a lecture called Smart Product Design with a main emphasis on hands-on experience. Apart from providing the basics of mechatronics, the students work on a real mobile robot system during the course. Each student team receives a mobile robot kit, based on a Motorola 68332 microcontroller. Each years course ends with a competition between the fully autonomous robots of the interdisciplinary student teams. In the recent years competitions the students had to build robots to autonomously construct towers, to play golf or soccer, or to collect Lego students to bring them to school. The article briefly discusses the important aspects of mechatronics education and then focuses on the Smart Product Design course at ETHZ, discussing the lecture, the laboratory work, and the experience gained during the last eight years.",

What is needed is a balance between theory and practice, between academic rigor and the best practices of industry, presented in an integrated way that feeds the needs of modern practicing engineers and the companies they work for. The new Master of Engineering in Mechatronics program attempts to remedy these deficiencies. The key element is the one-credit module which: balances theory and practice where concepts are application-driven, not theory-driven; identifies and understands industrial best practices by dissecting them into engineering and mathematical fundamental models; achieves innovation by assembling these fundamental models into new products and processes; analyzes both existing and new products and processes using computer simulations within a topic area; demonstrates hardware to show system realization and validity of modeling and analysis results; shows videos of industry systems and interviews with industry experts; discusses best practices to achieve sustainability of products; and maintains flexibility through 15 one-hour blocks of instruction - a 5-week mini-course or longer if preferred.",

The course is centered on laboratory experiences which teach integration across the mechanical, electrical, and control engineering disciplines. Within this broad focus, the labs emphasize the application of feedback design in a variety of contexts as a means to motivate the broader mechatronic design issues. The labs utilize PC-based hardware and software for rapid control prototyping on a target digital signal processing (DSP) board. This DSP board is programmed through a commercially available block-diagram-based graphical environment, in order to eliminate the need for low-level programming and thereby allow students to concentrate on the higher-level challenges posed in each lab exercise. A students lab performance is evaluated primarily through a one-on-one interview with a member of the teaching staff in conjunction with a conventional written lab report.",

The key element in mechatronics is the integration of these areas through the design process. The essential characteristic of a mechatronics engineer and the key to success in mechatronics is a balance between two sets of skills: modeling/analysis skills and experimentation/hardware implementation skills. Synergism and integration in design set a mechatronic system apart from a traditional, multidisciplinary system. Mechanical engineers are expected to design with synergy and integration and professors must now teach design accordingly. The paper describes the undergraduate program in mechatronics at Rensselaer, i.e., two senior-elective courses, mechatronics (fall semester) and mechatronic system design (spring semester), and in particular, the integration of the theory covered in lectures with the laboratory exercises. The hardware systems and projects used in both courses are described.",

A course in advanced mechatronics is described which is offered as a joint graduate-undergraduate course and is intended to be a second course in mechatronics. As opposed to many mechatronics courses, this course focuses more on intelligent product design than on DSP or controls applications. Another unique feature of the course is a class-wide project experience in which 10 separate teams work together on various subsystems of a complex robotic rover vehicle. The class was offered for the first time in the Spring of 1999 and 20 students, both graduate and undergraduate participated.",

The Mechatronics Engineering programme can more accurately be described as a Engineering Science program - the intention of MDB being to introduce some of the interdisciplinary aspects of Mechatronics Engineering to masters students. The `Motion Control of Mechatronic Devices was the original main theme though MDB has undergone an evolutionary process to (a) integrate some of the research themes of the Mads Clausen Institute as well as (b) trying to match the changing backgrounds and expectations of the Masters students. Originally an elective course, chosen mainly by students with an engineering background, the development of a new programme in 2009 saw MDB become compulsory across the Masters of Science in Mechatronics Degree. Additionally MDB became a compulsory component of another Masters program - Masters of Science in Innovation and Business. These changes have pushed MDB towards Product Innovation and Development with `classical mechatronics research projects now existing in parallel with product innovation and development projects in the project-based part of the course.",

The teaching of mechatronics is not well suited to the structure of the standard engineering curriculum, which has a highly disciplinary alignment. At the university level, successful mechatronics programs have emerged that can serve as models representing the various ways that mechatronics can be taught. One such program at the undergraduate level is the multi-course guided curriculum in mechatronics that is available to students in their senior year in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Washington. The culmination of this mechatronics thread is an intense, ten-week capstone design course in which students are organized into teams of three or four students each, with each team addressing a different significant, open-ended mechatronics project. Following a brief review of our mechatronics program as a whole, the curriculum into which it fits, and the individual constituent courses, described in this paper are our capstone design course and three typical projects from that course.",

However, very few existing mechatronics courses (at least those reported in the literature) feature a strong emphasis on mechanical design. That is is not to say that the creative process of design is not featured in mechatronics courses, because it clearly is. It seems equally clear that that accepted definition of mechatronics is not being adequately implemented in the classroom. This paper addresses this issue, suggests probable reasons for it and describes a new course being developed at Boise State University which places a much stronger emphasis on mechanical design skills and practice than many mechatronics courses.",

Forms of individualized instruction leading up to multimedia instruction are described, and a review of the integration of individualized instruction into a standard education curriculum is included. Discussed is a jointly defined effort between IBM and the California State University at Fullerton that demonstrated: (1) the benefits of a parallel course-development and course-implementation approach, (2) the superiority of multimedia over traditional instruction in the subject area tested, and (3) very low-cost development of quality multimedia courses. A projection by IBM for its own internal education program indicates that by the year 2000 not only will individualized instruction become fully integrated into IBMs education curriculum, but it will become the dominant approach, encompassing within it many aspects of traditional instruction. The continuing integration of individualized instruction with other technologies and advances in digital full-motion capabilities can help make multimedia instruction not only independent of time and place, but more engrossing and enjoyable as well.",

The obvious assignment, a group programming project, proved to be a poor choice when implemented in the authors computer graphics class. An examination of the literature in this area shows that a group programming project has many features in common with a group term paper, the assignment which has been uniquely identified as the worst choice for small group work. Fortunately, there are better choices for cooperative learning in computer science. Assignments with the three Ss: same problem, specific choice and simultaneous reporting of group choices, work well. This was implemented in a class by having students work multiple choice quizzes designed to require high level learning skills. Quizzes were first worked by individuals, then by small groups. The small group answers are then compared and discussed in class. This generates the type of interaction between the professor and students which creates positive cooperative learning experiences. Promising preliminary results have been seen with this method, from both the student and the professors perspective.",

            "abstract" : "We discuss three basic principles of modern robotics education and contrast the traditional teaching style used in a majority of engineering classes with that necessary for a rapidly developing field such as robotics. Our basic tenet is that a modern robotic engineer must have knowledge, experience, and insight. While traditional education methods focus on knowledge and experience through the standard lecture-laboratory cycle, we submit that insight is the key to a complete robotics education. We conjecture that insight cannot be gained from textbooks, lectures, and laboratory exercises alone, as these tend to focus on merely academic rather than global and social issues. We present a discussion of the techniques used at the United States Naval Academy to inform, educate, and motivate students in the field of robotics.",

Through this experience, the student confronts the hard realities of robot systems and learns to deal with them. Such hands-on experience is essential for a sound robotics education, because many critical lessons about the real world can only be learned through personal experience.",

The instructional material was developed to assist trainees in acquiring programming skills needed for small robot control. It allows self-paced learning in a laboratory situation by means of multimedia audio and visual information and is much more effective than the sole use of conventional textbooks in helping people working in the technical fields to understand robot motions and their control methods. This system differs in that self-paced learning is introduced mainly to facilitate and improve the quality of the communication between the instructor and students. The response of those attending the seminar using this material shows that this course has succeeded in this goal. The materials use results in increased trainee motivation, leading to enhanced learning, and suggests one direction in multimedia practices for engineering education.",

This article describes a package that combines recently developed Internet-based programming tools to generate three-dimensional virtual models of robot manipulators from a DH parameter table. Robot-Draw combines hypertext markup language (HTML), practical extraction and report language (PERL), and virtual reality modeling language (VRML). Internet users can generate three-dimensional robot manipulator models on their computer screens, navigate around the robot model and examine it from any angle. The package was designed as a visualization aid in robotics education and allows educators and students to easily visualize robotic structures and directly evaluate the effect of a parameter variation on the overall robot. Robot-Draw can also be a useful tool in the structural design of robot manipulators.

However, trying to open the black boxes is crucially important for the students who are going to be researchers or technical experts. Based on this idea, the curriculum of our department concerning practical robotics education was planned to cultivate the fundamental spirit of students for designing/manufacturing valuable products. In the article, first the basic concepts of practical engineering education are presented. Second, the outline of classes for practical education at the Department of Robotics in Ritsumeikan University are described, including experiments in robotics using 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) and 6-DOF manipulators and practices of robot making. Then, practical education for a cooperative academia-industry environment is described. Such an education should contribute to the production of valuable products and to the transfer of advanced technologies to industry.",

This paper has described an Internet-based teaching and experiment system for control engineering (ITESCE) that provides students with online course material, a simulator, an online control experiment using an arm robot, and the ability to store and search simulation and experimental results. To implement the functions required by the course and to facilitate connection to the Internet, the ITESCE is based on a standard browser/server architecture with three layers and employs multithreading, Java applets, and Java database connectivity. Background control subsystems handle the real-time control of experiments, and a network server handles communication with clients and with background control subsystems. A database stores simulation and experimental results. The course covers a variety of control methods, and students can try them out through online simulations and experiments. To enhance realism, a Web camera takes a video of an experiment and streams it to a students PC in real time.",

            "abstract" : "Swarthmore College takes a two-pronged approach to undergraduate education by integrating educational goals with robotics research. First, it offers courses in artificial intelligence, computer vision and robotics. Both AI and computer vision serve as prerequisites for the robotics course. Second, it involves students in ongoing research projects as part of their undergraduate experience. To keep up with the wide-ranging, fast-moving robotics field, education must be adaptive and multidisciplinary. The authors describe two undergraduate group projects they conducted, one from 1998 at the University of North Dakota advised by Maxwell, and one from 1999 at Swarthmore advised by both authors. The impetus for these projects was the American Association for Artificial Intelligences (AAAIs) annual robot competition. These experiences led to the development of a new robotics course at Swarthmore, which they co-taught in the spring of 2000.",

It presents experiences at the United States Air Force Academy, USAF Academy, CO; Pennsylvania State University-Abington; and Trinity College, Hartford, CT, together with the results of the contest surveys conducted in collaboration with The Technion*Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa. The primary goal of the design project is to create an autonomous mobile robot that navigates through a maze searching for a fire (simulated by a burning candle), detects the candles flame, extinguishes the flame, and returns to a designated starting location in the maze. The fire-fighting design contest promotes interdisciplinary design and teamwork. To accomplish the stated goal, students must integrate knowledge gained from such classes as engineering design, circuits, controls, signals and systems, computer programming, mathematics, and engineering mechanics. Within the three institutions, the contest has been successfully utilized as a foundation for a wide range of educational goals. These activities include freshman design, robotics courses, K-12 outreach, senior design projects, and undergraduate research.",

            "abstract" : "A persistent problem facing todays engineering educators is how to promote students interest in science and engineering. One of the best approaches to this challenge is to sponsor a technological competition that combines publicity, technology, and student participation. A current leading competition called micromouse, although earning high marks on publicity and technology, has had difficulty attracting large-scale student participation. In this paper a vision-guided autonomous vehicle project developed at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) is proposed as an alternative. The idea is to fit an ordinary radio-controlled toy car with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and a transmitter. Image processing and control of the car are accomplished by a personal computer (PC). The road image captured by the camera is transmitted to a PC via a transmitter-receiver pair at 900 MHz. A frame grabber board digitizes the image, and an image-processing program subsequently analyzes the road condition and generates adequate drive commands that are transmitted back to the vehicle via the built-in radio controller. Student teams write programs to compete in racing or maze solving. In this paper detailed hardware and software designs of the project are presented. The merit of the project with respect to the criteria of publicity, technology, and student participation is also addressed.",

Current humanoid robots, however, lack in adaptability, agility, or high-mobility enough to meet the expectations. In order to enhance high-mobility, the humanoid motion should be generated in real-time in accordance with the dynamics, which commonly requires a large amount of computation and has not been implemented so far. We have developed a real-time motion generation method that controls the center of gravity (COG) by indirect manipulation of the zero moment point (ZMP). The real-time response of the method provides humanoid robots with high-mobility. In the paper, the algorithm is presented. It consists of four parts, namely, the referential ZMP planning, the ZMP manipulation, the COG velocity decomposition to joint angles, and local control of joint angles. An advantage of the algorithm lies in its applicability to humanoids with a lot of degrees of freedom. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by computer simulations.",

There were lots of demos and pilot systems, but except for vehicle simulators and entertainment applications, VR was not yet in production use doing real work. This year he was invited to do an up-to-date assessment of VR, with funding to visit major centers in North America and Europe. Every one of the component technologies has made big strides. Moreover, I found that there now exist some VR applications routinely operated for the results they produce.",

The project was implemented in an introductory course on system identification within the curriculum of electrical engineering, a fourth-year undergraduate course taken by 30 students. We offer a global outline of the new course format in which the designed environment was implemented. We also give more insight into the practical realization of the designed environment, and finally, the results from the use of the environment are presented and discussed.",

Remotely located students are able to develop, compile, debug, and run controllers in real time on the experiments in our laboratory.

A problem-based learning course is described as a possible method of developing both higher level cognitive and personal and interpersonal skills, and the implications of such an approach are discussed.

By using Web lectures to present lecture material before class, more in-class time can be spent engaging students with hands-on learning activities-using class time for more learning by doing, less learning by listening. A quasi-experiment was conducted over a 15-week semester with 46 students in two sections of the same course-one section using Web lectures and one using traditional lectures. Many control measures were in place, including each section being taught by the same instructor and blind grading being used. The Web lecture sections grades were significantly higher than the traditional lecture section, and Web lecture students reported increasingly strong positive attitudes about the intervention. The twofold contribution of this work is a novel use of existing technology to improve learning and a longitudinal, quasi-experimental evaluation of its use in context",

While this is the promise of higher education, a substantial body of research indicates that cognitive growth remains elusive for most universities and for most disciplines, including engineering. In this paper, we discuss a framework for facilitating open ended problem solving through the use of an inverted classroom. A basic premise of the inverted classroom model is that richer open-ended problem solving experiences can be conducted within the classroom environment. Required readings and preparatory work through online interactive materials provide one opportunity for intellectual diversity and allow lectures to be replaced with more engaged pedagogies that require problems to be viewed from multiple perspectives. An example format and preliminary data for a course in cost estimating is presented.",

            "abstract" : "Beginning fall 2001, the Electrical Engineering Department at Texas A&M University, College Station, significantly altered the instructional philosophy of the ELEN 214 Electric Circuit Theory course by introducing more engineering design into the curriculum and adopting the WebCT-based interactive homework submission system. This paper will discuss the use of the Quiz tool within WebCT for the construction of question banks and their publication to a WebCT server. An example, deriving mathematical expressions, which describes electric circuit behavior and helps customize the homework problems to each individual student, are discussed. In other words, in a class of 200 students, each student is presented with an individual homework assignment with a unique set of problems not repeated to anyone else via WebCT. A help desk staffed by senior undergraduates assists the course students in completing the WebCT-based homework on time. WebCT is an essential ingredient in the delivery of the course. The approach presented in this paper can be adapted to any other course in engineering/science that involves mathematical calculations. So far, the course evaluations suggest that the students are more motivated and excited about electrical and computer engineering as a career.",

            "abstract" : "This paper presents a comparison of online to traditional face-to-face delivery of undergraduate digital systems material. Two specific components of digital content were compared and evaluated: a sophomore logic circuits course with no laboratory, and a microprocessor laboratory component of a junior-level computer systems course. For each of these, a baseline level of student understanding was evaluated when they were being taught using traditional, face-to-face delivery. The course and lab component were then converted to being fully online, and the level of student understanding was again measured. In both cases, the same purpose-developed assessment tools were used to carry out the measurement of understanding. This paper presents the details of how the course components were converted to online delivery, including a discussion of the technology used to accomplish remote access of the electronic test equipment used in the laboratory. A comparison is then presented between the control and the experimental groups, including a statistical analysis of whether the delivery approach impacted student learning. Finally, student satisfaction is discussed, and instructor observations are given for the successful remote delivery of this type of class and laboratory.",

The methodology and its application to education in elementary circuit analysis is discussed in detail. Because of administrative constraints, the implemented course does not strictly adhere to the PBL methodology in the sense that the course curriculum is strictly defined. Also, the PBL students take the same exam as the students in the traditional form of the course. The learning experience in the two course forms is compared via a questionnaire response and exam results. This comparison of the two groups seems to indicate that the PBL method is a better way of imparting education in circuit analysis, or even technology in general. The PBL students appear to grasp better the details and the overall picture of the issues taught. In addition to the subject matter, the PBL course students learn social skills through interaction in small groups, how to identify and define a problem, and how to look for and filter out relevant information. Presentation skills are also practiced",

Thus this population affords a rich source of data to begin to answer the research questions of what engineering educators believe are effective teaching practices and what they actually do in the classroom. Since poor teaching has been shown to contribute to student attrition from engineering, studying the beliefs and practices of faculty who are committed to teaching may provide ideas of how to improve engineering education in general. For this study, interviews were conducted with twenty-six engineering educators at FIE06. Participants were asked to describe what they believed were effective teaching practices. Next, participants were asked to consider a list of teaching practices and rank these according to what they believed were most effective and which they actually utilized. In this work, we provide the initial results of this study thereby offering insights into the variation and degree of consensus on effective teaching among this self-selected population of engineering educators.",

            "abstract" : "The signal processing community needs quantitative standardized tools to assess student learning in order to improve teaching methods and satisfy accreditation requirements. The Signals and Systems Concept Inventory (SSCI) is a 25-question multiple-choice exam designed to measure students understanding of fundamental concepts taught in standard signals and systems curricula. When administered as a pre- and postcourse assessment, the SSCI measures the gain in conceptual understanding as a result of instruction. This paper summarizes the three-year development of this new assessment instrument and presents results obtained from testing with a pool of over 900 students from seven schools. Initial findings from the SSCI study show that students in traditional lecture courses master approximately 20% of the concepts they do not know prior to the start of the course. Other results highlight the most common student misconceptions and quantify the correlation between signals and systems and prerequisite courses.",

It is not necessary to fit geometric primitives to the sampled data; images are formed by directly shading each sample and projecting it onto the picture plane. Surface-shading calculations are performed at every voxel with local gradient vectors serving as surface normals. In a separate step, surface classification operators are applied to compute a partial opacity of every voxel. Operators that detect isovalue contour surfaces and region boundary surfaces are examined. The technique is simple and fast, yet displays surfaces exhibiting smooth silhouettes and few other aliasing artifacts. The use of selective blurring and supersampling to further improve image quality is described. Examples from molecular graphics and medical imaging are given.",

A small-scale prototype of the architecture has been realized in hardware and has been operating in true real-time, faster than the alternative voxel systems. The Cube architecture is centered around a 3-D cubic frame buffer, of voxels, and it entertains three processors that access the frame buffer to input sampled and synthetic data, to manipulate the 3-D images, and to project and render them. To cope with the huge quantity of voxels and still perform in real-time, two special features were incorporated within the architecture: a unique skewed memory organization, which permits the retrieval and storage of voxels in parallel, and a multiple-write bus, which speeds up the viewing process. These features allow Cube, for example, to project an image of n/sup 3/ voxels in O(n/sup 2/ log n) time rather than the conventional O(n/sup 3/) time.",

            "abstract" : "Direction finding techniques for determining the position on the surface directly above a small electromagnetic (loop) transmitter were tested at two hardrock mines and two coal mines in the fall of 1971. The actual locations of the underground transmitters in each case were projected to the surface using mine maps and conventional surveying techniques. A crossed loop direction finding receiver was developed to respond to the magnetic field. A null in the horizontal magnetic field was used to identify the surface location directly above the transmitter. Evaluation of this system at five locations in the four mines revealed location errors of 13 meters, 7 meters, 3 meters, 2 meters and 0. 5 meters respectively. Theoretical computations of magnetic field strengths based on transmitter frequency, ground conductivity and transmitter depth are shown along with measured profiles for two of the four mines visited. The effects of uniformly sloping terrain and dipole tilt are also examined theoretically and the results are shown to be consistent with the field measurements made under these conditions. Using known theoretical corrections for hill slope, it is shown that the measured source location can be improved to where it is within three meters of the actual location.",

Restricting attention to right-handed coordinate systems and positive rotations, twelve distinct but equivalent sets of Euler angles are partitioned into two subsets. The method of determining a set of orthogonal infinitesimal rotations equivalent to nonorthogonal infinitesimal increments on a set of Euler angles is illustrated. It is shown that the same solution yields expressions for the angular velocities of the final coordinate system relative to the reference coordinate system in terms of derivatives of the Euler angles. The ease with which the infinitesimal increments of one Euler set in terms of the increments of another equivalent Euler set can be determined by the symbolic technique is illustrated. This technique offers a systematic approach to error analysis of sequences of rotations.",

TWOWAY functions symmetrically, employing a relatively simple electromagnetic signal which is alternately received from, processed and transmitted to the other body in a transponding or multiplexed fashion. The result is that TWOWAY can provide in each body a measure of: the two pointing angles and range which define the direction to and the position of the other body plus, the three Euler angles (or direction cosines) which define the relative orientation between the two bodies. TWOWAY consists of an antenna which is precisely fixed and oriented to its body; the signals received from and transmitted to the other body are processed by the System Electronics Unit (SEU). A suitable display or control interface is also required depending upon the application. In this paper, TWOWAY components and options are described; their function in TWOWAY operation is explained.",

In addition, a stochastic analysis which gives the probability distribution of the breakdown utilization of randomly generated task sets is presented. It is shown that as the task set size increases, the task computation times become of little importance, and the breakdown utilization converges to a constant determined by the task periods. For uniformly distributed tasks, a breakdown utilization of 88% is a reasonable characterization. A case is shown in which the average-case breakdown utilization reaches the worst-case lower bound of C.L. Liu and J.W. Layland (1973).",

            "abstract" : "The paper presents exact schedulability analyses for real-time systems scheduled at runtime with a static priority pre-emptive dispatcher. The tasks to be scheduled are allowed to experience internal blocking (from other tasks with which they share resources) and (with certain restrictions) to release jitter, such as waiting for a message to arrive. The analysis presented is more general than that previously published and subsumes, for example, techniques based on the rate monotonic approach. In addition to presenting the relevant theory, an existing avionics case study is described and analysed. The predictions that follow from this analysis are seen to be in close agreement with the behaviour exhibited during simulation studies.",

The paper discusses feasibility decision for a given real time task system by the rate monotonic scheduling algorithm. It presents a new necessary and sufficient condition for a given task system to be feasible, and a new feasibility decision algorithm based on that condition. The time complexity of this algorithm depends solely on the number of tasks. This algorithm can be applied to the inverse deadline scheduling algorithm, which is an extension of the rate monotonic scheduling algorithm.",

This protocol also prevents the formation of deadlocks. Sufficient conditions under which a set of periodic tasks using this protocol may be scheduled is derived.",

The system is deemed schedulable if the calculated response-time for each process is less than its corresponding deadline. It is desirable that the Response-Time Analysis (RTA) can be efficiently performed. This is particularly important in dynamic real-time systems when a fast response is needed to decide whether a new job can be accommodated, or when the RTA is extensively applied, e.g., when used to guide the heuristics in a higher level optimiser. This paper presents a set of methods to improve the efficiency of RTA calculations. The methods are proved correct, in the sense that they give the same results as traditional (non-improved) RTA. We also present an evaluation of the improvements, by applying them to the particularly time-consuming traffic model used in RTA for ATM communication networks. Our evaluation shows that the proposed methods can give an order of magnitude reduction of the execution time of RTA.",

The proposed test has the same complexity as the original Liu and Layland (1973) bound, but it is less pessimistic, thus allowing it to accept task sets that would be rejected using the original approach. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated with respect to the classical Liu and Layland method and theoretical bounds are derived as a function of n (the number of tasks) and for the limit case of n tending to infinity. The analysis is also extended to include aperiodic servers and blocking times due to concurrency control protocols. Extensive simulations on synthetic tasks sets are presented to compare the effectiveness of the proposed test with respect to the Liu and Layland method and the exact response time analysis.",

The schedulability of adjustable periodic processes by a preemptive fixed priority scheduler is formulated in terms of a configuration selection problem. Specifically, two process transformations are introduced for the purpose of deriving a bound for the achievable utilization factor of processes whose periods are related by harmonics. This result is then generalized so that the bound is applicable to any process set and an efficient algorithm to calculate the bound is provided. When the list of allowable configurations is implicitly given by a set of scalable periodic processes, the corresponding period assignment problem is shown to be NP-complete. The authors present an approximation algorithm for the period assignment problem for which some encouraging experimental results are included.",

            "abstract" : "Utilization bound is a well-known concept first introduced in the seminal paper of Liu and Layland (1973) which provides a simple and practical way to test the schedulability of a real-time task set. The original utilization bound for the fixed-priority scheduler was given as a function of the number of tasks in the periodic task set. We define the utilization bound as a function of the information about the task set. By making use of more than just the number of tasks, we obtain various improvements over the Liu and Layland bound. In particular, we give a more intuitive derivation of the bound as a function of the number of harmonic chains in the task periods which allows us to derive a simpler algorithm to calculate such bounds. We derive algorithms that yield better bounds as a function of the period parameters of the task set. We also give a generalization of the bound for tasks whose deadlines are smaller than their periods.",

In this work, we fill an important gap between these two, by presenting a technique for deriving utilization bounds, based on linear programming, that is applicable to similarly generalized situations, but does not require knowledge of exact task computation times.",

Observations are made to reduce the number of LP problem instances required to be solved, which greatly improves the computation time of the utilization bounds. Furthermore, additional constraints are allowed to be included under certain circumstances to improve the quality of the bounds.",

A key feature of DASH is its distributed direction-based cache coherence protocol. Unlike traditional snoopy coherence protocols, the DASH protocol does not rely on broadcast; instead it uses point-to-point messages sent between the processors and memories to keep caches consistent. Furthermore, the DASH system does not contain any single serialization or control point. While these features provide the basis for scalability, they also force a reevaluation of many fundamental issues involved in the design of a protocol. These include the issues of correctness, performance, and protocol complexity. The design of the DASH coherence protocol is presented and discussed from the viewpoint of how it addresses the above issues. Also discussed is a strategy for verifying the correctness of the protocol. A brief comparison of the protocol with the IEEE Scalable Coherent Interface protocol is made.",

            "abstract" : "The design challenge for large-scale multiprocessors is (1) to minimize communication overhead, (2) allow communication to overlap computation, and (3) coordinate the two without sacrificing processor cost/performance. We show that existing message passing multiprocessors have unnecessarily high communication costs. Research prototypes of message driven machines demonstrate low communication overhead, but poor processor cost/performance. We introduce a simple communication mechanism, Active Messages, show that it is intrinsic to both architectures, allows cost effective use of the hardware, and offers tremendous flexibility. Implementations on nCUBE/2 and CM-5 are described and evaluated using a split-phase shared-memory extension to C, Split-C. We further show that active messages are sufficient to implement the dynamically scheduled languages for which message driven machines were designed. With this mechanism, latency tolerance becomes a programming/compiling concern. Hardware support for active messages is desirable and we outline a range of enhancements to mainstream processors.",

It is based on an event-driven timing simulator called SWEC. Our approach uses optimistic scheduling to take advantage of the latency of digital signals. Using data from trace-driven analysis, we demonstrate that optimistic scheduling exploits more parallelism than conservative scheduling for circuits with feedback signal paths. We then describe the PARSWEC implementation and discuss several design trade-offs. Speedups over SWEC on large circuits are as high as 55 on a 64-node CM5 multiprocessor. These results indicate that the feasibility of using distributed memory multiprocessors for large-scale circuit simulation.",

We have developed algorithms for process graph scheduling based on list scheduling and branch and bound strategies. One essential contribution is in the manner in which information on process allocation is used in order to efficiently derive a good quality or optimal schedule. Experiments show the superiority of these algorithms compared to previous approaches like critical path heuristics and ILP based optimal scheduling. An extension of our approach allows the scheduling of conditional process graphs capturing both data and control flow. In this case a schedule table has to be generated so that the worst case delay is minimized.",

Further, many languages not originally designed as ADLs serve reasonably well at representing and analyzing software architectures. This paper summarizes a taxonomic survey of ADLs that is in progress. The survey characterizes ADLs in terms of: the classes of systems they support; the inherent properties of the languages themselves; and the process and technology support they provide to represent, refine, analyze, and build systems from an architecture. Preliminary results allow us to draw conclusions about what constitutes an ADL, and how contemporary ADLs differ from each other.",

            "abstract" : "The authors describe LUSTRE, a data flow synchronous language designed for programming reactive systems-such as automatic control and monitoring systems-as well as for describing hardware. The data flow aspect of LUSTRE makes it very close to usual description tools in these domains (block-diagrams, networks of operators, dynamical sample-systems, etc.), and its synchronous interpretation makes it well suited for handling time in programs. Moreover, this synchronous interpretation allows it to be compiled into an efficient sequential program. The LUSTRE formalism is very similar to temporal logics. This allows the language to be used for both writing programs and expressing program properties, which results in an original program verification methodology.",

            "abstract" : "This paper extends the two-level hierarchical scheme in (Deng et al., 1997) for scheduling independently developed real-time applications with non-real-time applications in an open environment. The environment allows the schedulability of each real-time application to be validated independently of other applications in the system. The extended scheme removes the following two restrictions of the scheme: real-time applications that are scheduled preemptively must consist solely of periodic tasks; and applications must not share global resources (i.e., resources used by more than one application). Consequently, the extended scheme can accommodate a much broader spectrum of real-time applications.",

Periodic tasks are composed of serially executed subtasks, where each subtask is characterized by an execution time, a fixed priority and a deadline. A method for determining the schedulability of each task and subtask is presented along with its theoretical underpinnings. This method can be used to analyze the schedulability of any task set on a uniprocessor whose priority structure can be modeled as serially executed subtasks, which can lead to a very complex priority structure. Important examples include task sets that involve interrupts, certain synchronization protocols, certain precedence constraints, nonpreemptible sections, and some message-passing systems. The method is illustrated by a robotics example.",

            "abstract" : "When executing different real-time applications on a single processor system, one problem is how to compose these applications and guarantee at the same time that their timing requirements are not violated. A possible way of composing applications is through the resource reservation approach. Each application is handled by a dedicated server that is assigned a fraction of the processor. Using this approach, the system can be seen as a two-level hierarchical scheduler. A considerable amount of work has been recently addressed to the analysis of this kind of hierarchical systems. However, a question is still unanswered: given a set of real-time tasks to be handled by a server, how to assign the server parameters so that the task set is feasible? In this paper, we answer to the previous question for the case of fixed priority local scheduler by presenting a methodology for computing the class of server parameters that make the task set feasible.",

            "abstract" : "In real-time resource partitioning, a shared resource is partitioned by a resource-level scheduler such that each partition is accessible only by an individual application task group. Tasks within the same task group are scheduled by an application-task-level scheduler that is specialized to the real-time requirements of the tasks in the group. An ideal goal for resource partitioning in real-time systems is to achieve a complete separation of concerns so that: (1) each task group may be executed as if it had access to its own dedicated resource, and (2) there is minimal interaction between the resource-level scheduler and the application-task-level scheduler. In [15], we introduced the notion of a real-time virtual resource which operates at a fraction of the rate of the shared physical resource and whose rate of operation varies with time but is bounded. In this paper we discuss an approach to bound the variation of the rate of operation of a real-time virtual resource by characterizing the rate variation from both temporal and supply dimensions and by expanding on the concept of regularity that was first introduced in [19]. For the case of regular resource partitioning, we show that the utilization bounds of both fixed-priority scheduling and dynamic-priority scheduling remain unchanged from those for dedicated resources. We determine the utilization bounds for the more general case of irregular partitioning. In particular, both types of partitions can be efficiently constructed by exploiting compositionality, properties vis-a-vis the regularity measure.",

In a 2001 paper, we introduced the notion of a real-time virtual resource which operates at a fraction of the rate of the shared physical resource and whose rate of service provision varies with time but is bounded. The shared resource is partitioned into real-time virtual resources by a resource-level scheduler such that each real-time virtual resource is accessible only by an individual application task group; tasks within the same task group are scheduled by an application-task-level scheduler that is specialized to the real-time requirements of the tasks in the group. In this paper we propose a hierarchical real-time virtual resource model that permits resource partitioning to be extended to multiple levels. Through this model, partitions on each level are scheduled as if they had access to a dedicated resource and there is minimal interference between neighboring partition levels. We also investigate the partitioning of real-time virtual resources subject to scheduling quantum requirements.",

            "abstract" : "Hierarchical CPU scheduling has emerged as a way to (1) support applications with diverse scheduling requirements in open systems, and (2) provide load isolation between applications, users, and other resource principals. Most existing work on hierarchical scheduling has focused on systems that provide a fixed scheduling model: the schedulers in part or all of the hierarchy are specified in advance. In this paper we describe a system of guarantees that permits a general hierarchy of soft real-time schedulers one that contains arbitrary scheduling algorithms at all points within the hierarchy - to be analyzed. This analysis results in deterministic guarantees for threads at the leaves of the hierarchy. We also describe the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of a system for supporting such a hierarchy in the Windows 2000 kernel. Finally, we show that complex scheduling behaviors can be created using small schedulers as components and describe the HLS programming environment.",

We first propose a resource model to characterize a periodic resource allocation and present exact schedulability conditions for our proposed resource model under the EDF and RM algorithms. Using the exact schedulability conditions, we then provide methods to abstract the timing requirements that a set of periodic tasks demands under the EDF and RM algorithms as a single periodic task. With these abstraction methods, for a hierarchy of schedulers, we introduce a composition method that derives the timing requirements of a parent scheduler from the timing requirements of its child schedulers in a compositional manner such that the timing requirement of the parent scheduler is satisfied, if and only if the timing requirements of its child schedulers are satisfied.",

The two essential problems in developing such a framework are: (1) to abstract the collective real-time requirements of a component as a single real-time requirement and (2) to compose the component demand abstraction results into the system-level real-time requirement. In our earlier work, we addressed the problems using the Liu and Layland periodic model. In this paper, we address the problems using another well-known model, a bounded-delay resource partition model, as a solution model to the problems. To extend our framework to this model, we develop an exact feasibility condition for a set of bounded-delay tasks over a bounded-delay resource partition. In addition, we present simulation results to evaluate the overheads that the component demand abstraction results incur in terms of utilization increase. We also present utilization bound results on a bounded-delay resource model.",

            "abstract" : "The network time protocol (NTP), which is designed to distribute time information in a large, diverse system, is described. It uses a symmetric architecture in which a distributed subnet of time servers operating in a self-organizing, hierarchical configuration synchronizes local clocks within the subnet and to national time standards via wire, radio, or calibrated atomic clock. The servers can also redistribute time information within a network via local routing algorithms and time daemons. The NTP synchronization system, which has been in regular operation in the Internet for the last several years, is described, along with performance data which show that timekeeping accuracy throughout most portions of the Internet can be ordinarily maintained to within a few milliseconds, even in cases of failure or disruption of clocks, time servers, or networks.",

            "abstract" : "In recent years we have witnessed that switched Ethernet is on the way to get a predominant position in the automation world. From a communication point of view the introduction of the IEEE 802.1p traffic prioritization standard is an important milestone on the road towards deterministic Ethernet, that has made it possible to predict worst case latency over a switched Ethernet infrastructure. However, the missing link with respect to achieving an application-to-application predictable transfer time has been the ability to control the latency behavior within the end-nodes that may cause severe jitter. We present a generic concept for introducing also a prioritization mechanism into the protocol stacks and give arguments for applying these mechanisms within automation networks in order to obtain deterministic Ethernet node-to-node. The argumentation is followed by real-world measurements showing promising results.",

            "abstract" : "In the automation world the intelligent electrical devices need to be accurately synchronized for time stamping of data and motion control. We discuss how to achieve precise time synchronization over switched Ethernet networks in a generic way. The addressed synchronization requirements relate to substation automation, which is associated with five levels of synchronization accuracy defined as the IEC 61850 classes T1 to T5. The paper challenges the hardest requirements and presents general solutions for IEC classes T4/T5 (4 /spl mu/s/1 /spl mu/s) and IEC class 3 (25 /spl mu/s) in multi-traffic LAN environments. The classes T4/T5 solution is based on an Ethernet switch from OnTime Networks, while the class T3 solution relies on standard Ethernet switches. Common for both solutions is that they adhere to a low-level time stamp implementation of the Simple Network Time Protocol.",

            "abstract" : "Modern embedded computing systems tend to be heterogeneous in the sense of being composed of subsystems with very different characteristics, which communicate and interact in a variety of ways-synchronous or asynchronous, buffered or unbuffered, etc. Obviously, when designing such systems, a modeling language needs to reflect this heterogeneity. Todays modeling environments usually offer a variant of what we call amorphous heterogeneity to address this problem. This paper argues that modeling systems in this manner leads to unexpected and hard-to-analyze interactions between the communication mechanisms and proposes a more structured approach to heterogeneity, called hierarchical heterogeneity, to solve this problem. It proposes a model structure and semantic framework that support this form of heterogeneity, and discusses the issues arising from heterogeneous component interaction and the desire for component reuse. It introduces the notion of domain polymorphism as a way to address these issues.",

The synchronous approach is then introduced informally and its possible impact on the design of real-time and reactive systems is discussed. The authors present and discuss the application fields and the principles of synchronous programming. The major concern of the synchronous approach is to base synchronous programming languages on mathematical models. This makes it possible to handle compilation, logical correctness proofs, and verification of real-time programs in a formal way, leading to a clean and precise methodology for design and programming.",

The interfaces to actors are parameters and ports (vs. members and methods in object-oriented languages). Actors interact with one another through their ports via a messaging schema that can follow any of several concurrent semantics (vs. procedure calls, with prevail in OO languages). Domain-specific actor-oriented languages and frameworks are common (e.g. Simulink, LabVIEW, and many others). However, they lack many of the modularity and abstraction mechanisms that programmers have become accustomed to in 00 languages, such as classes, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism. This extended abstract shows the form that such mechanisms might take in AO languages. A prototype of these mechanisms realized in Ptolemy II is described.",

            "abstract" : "We give a denotational framework (a meta model) within which certain properties of models of computation can be compared. It describes concurrent processes in general terms as sets of possible behaviors. A process is determinate if, given the constraints imposed by the inputs, there are exactly one or exactly zero behaviors. Compositions of processes are processes with behaviors in the intersection of the behaviors of the component processes. The interaction between processes is through signals, which are collections of events. Each event is a value-tag pair, where the tags can come from a partially ordered or totally ordered set. Timed models are where the set of tags is totally ordered. Synchronous events share the same tag, and synchronous signals contain events with the same set of tags. Synchronous processes have only synchronous signals as behaviors. Strict causality (in timed tag systems) and continuity (in untimed tag systems) ensure determinacy under certain technical conditions. The framework is used to compare certain essential features of various models of computation, including Kahn process networks, dataflow, sequential processes, concurrent sequential processes with rendezvous, Petri nets, and discrete-event systems.",

Instructions have a single format and contain an operand, index control bits, and two independent operation codes called &#x201C;transfer&#x201D; code and &#x201C;compute&#x201D; code. The first code specifies the transfer of a data word over the common data bus, e.g., from data memory to a local register. The second determines an operation of the ALU on the contents of local registers. A fast free-running multiplier operates in parallel with the ALU and delivers a product in every cycle with a pipeline delay of two cycles. The architecture allows transversal-filter operations to be performed with one multiplication and ALU operation in every cycle. This is accomplished by a novel interleaving technique called ZIP-ing. The efficiency of the processor is demonstrated by programming examples.",

            "abstract" : "In many computational tasks, especially in signal processing, it is the throughput that is important, rather than the latency, or delay. If a special-purpose VLSI chip is designed for a particular signal processing task, such as FIR filtering, for example, the maximum clock rate, and hence throughput, is determined by the depth of the combinational logic between registers and the time required for the distribution and operation of the clock. If the combinational logic is sufficiently deep (in bit-parallel circuits, for example), the throughput can be increased by inserting intermediate stages of clocked latches. This is at the expense of increased area and delay to operate and clock the intermediate registers. Roughly speaking, the strategy amounts to using more of the chip area to store information useful for pipelining. This paper investigates the optimal tradeoff between the degree of intermediate latching and cost, using the measure AP, where A is the chip area and P is the period (the reciprocal of throughput). We derive expressions for the time and area before and after intermediate latching, using the Mead-Conway model, both for the cases of on-chip and off-chip clock drivers. The results show that significant reductions in AP product (reciprocal of throughput per unit area) can be achieved by intermediate latching in many typical signal processing applications, for a wide range of circuit parameters. The array multiplier is used as an example.",

            "abstract" : "This paper presents quantitative techniques for the evaluation and comparison of pipelined digital systems. They are based on three measures of effectiveness: delay, average time/operation, and average cost/operation. Moreover, the techniques do not assume that there is an unbounded stream of operations to be performed, although this case is considered. The use of the analysis methods to compare different ways of pipelining a given algorithm is illustrated by an investigation of the pipelining of general four-neighbor cellular arrays. The methods can also be used to evaluate different algorithms for performing the same operation. This is illustrated by comparing three array algorithns for integer multiplication.",

The leaf-connected tree structure is used to construct a completely-pipelined bit-serial multiplier and a completely-pipelined word-serial, bit-serial convolver. The mesh-connected tree structure is used to implement completely-pipelined bit-parallel multiplication and completely-pipelined word-parallel bit-parallel convolution. Layouts are described that are within log factors of asymptotic optimality. It is shown that, asymptotically, the area required for power distribution actually dominates the rest of the area for a wide class of structures. This illustrates the importance of studying the constants of proportionality in evaluating area, time, and energy requirements, and suggests that the choice of topologies may very well depend on the fabrication technology. The importance of parameterized and high-level design is stressed throughout. Also stressed is the idea of applying sound architectural technique at all levels of information organization, including, in particular, the bit level.",

            "abstract" : "A hierarchical model of computer organizations is developed, based on a tree model using request/service type resources as nodes. Two aspects of the model are distinguished: logical and physical. General parallel- or multiple-stream organizations are examined as to type and effectiveness-especially regarding intrinsic logical difficulties. The overlapped simplex processor (SISD) is limited by data dependencies. Branching has a particularly degenerative effect. The parallel processors [single-instruction stream-multiple-data stream (SIMD)] are analyzed. In particular, a nesting type explanation is offered for Minskys conjecture-the performance of a parallel processor increases as log M instead of M (the number of data stream processors). Multiprocessors (MIMD) are subjected to a saturation syndrome based on general communications lockout. Simplified queuing models indicate that saturation develops when the fraction of task time spent locked out (L/E) approaches 1/n, where n is the number of processors. Resources sharing in multiprocessors can be used to avoid several other classic organizational problems.",

The Heterogeneous Element Processor (HEP) built by Denelcor Incorporated is the first commercially available computer system to use pipelining to implement multiple processes. This paper introduces the architecture and programming environment of the HEP and surveys a range of scientific applications programs for which parallel versions have been produced, tested, and analyzed on this computer. In all cases, the ideal of one instruction completion every pipeline step time is closely approached. Speed limitations in the parallel programs are more often a result of the extra code necessary to ensure synchronization than of actual synchronization lockout at execution time. The pipelined multiple instruction stream architecture is shown to cover a wide range of applications with good utilization of the parallel hardware.",

            "abstract" : "This paper describes a heuristic approach for solving the problem of dynamically scheduling tasks in a real-time system where tasks have deadlines and general resource requirements. The crux of our approach lies in the heuristic function used to select the task to be scheduled next. The heuristic function is composed of three weighted factors. These factors explicitly consider information about real-time constraints of tasks and their utilization of resources. Simulation studies show that the weights for the various factors in the heuristic function have to be fine-tuned in order to obtain a degree of success in the range of 75-88 percent of that obtained via exhaustive search. However, modifying the approach to use limited backtracking improves the degree of success substantially to as high as 99.5 percent. This improvement is observed even when the initial set of weights are not tailored for a particular set of tasks. Simulation studies also show that in most cases the schedule determined by the heuristic algorithm is optimal or close to optimal.",

The analysis is based on a formal logic, RTL (real-time logic), which is especially suitable for reasoning about the timing behavior of systems. Given the formal specification of a system and a safety assertion to be analyzed, the goal is to relate the safety assertion to the systems specification. There are three distinct cases: (1) the safety assertion is a theorem derivable from the systems specification; (2) the safety assertion is unsatisfiable with respect to the systems specification; or (3) the negation of the safety assertion is satisfiable under certain conditions. A systematic method for performing safety analysis is presented.",

This approach is a generalization of serializability theory in that the set of permissible transaction schedules contains all the serializable schedules. In addition to providing a higher degree of concurrency than that provided by serializability theory, this approach retains three important properties associated with serializability: the consistency of the database is preserved, the individual transactions are executed correctly, and the concurrency control approach is modular. The authors formalize the last concept. The associated failure recovery procedure is presented, as is the concept of failure safety (i.e. failure tolerance).",

            "abstract" : "A computer-controlled system is a synergistic coupling of the controlled process and the controller computer. We have defined new performance measures for real-time controller computers based on this coupling. We present a systematic study of a typical critical controlled process in the context of new performance measures that express the performance of both controlled processes and controller computers (taken as a unit) on the basis of a single variable: controller response time. Controller response time is a function of current system state, system failure rate, electrical and/or magnetic interference, etc., and is therefore a random variable. Control overhead is expressed as monotonically nondecreasing function of the response time and the system suffers catastrophic failure, or dynamic failure, if the response time for a control task exceeds the corresponding system hard deadline, if any. The controlled-process chosen for study is an aircraft in the final stages of descent, just prior to landing. Control constraints are particularly severe during this period, and great care must be taken in the design of controllers that handle this process. First, the performance measures for the controller are presented. Second, control algorithms for solving the landing problem are discussed, and finally the impact of our performance measures on the problem is analyzed, showing that the performance measures and the associated estimation method have potential use for designing and/or evaluating real-time controllers and controlled process. In common with all other control techniques, the computational complexity involved in obtaining these measures is susceptible to the curse of dimensionality.",

This optimization is a difficult problem, and heuristics and designer judgment are called for in the process. The chief cause of the difficulty is the large number of parameters under the designers control which impact performance and life-cycle cost. We study the interplay between the more important parameters in this paper using two objective measures, i. e., the mean cost and the probability of dynamic failure in [6], [10]. Among these are the processor burn-in time and processor replacement policy. A central feature of this work is a look at how the application requirements affect the optimality of the distributed systems; indeed, the application requirements are an integral part of the analysis.",

            "abstract" : "The problem of system simulation is typically solved in a sequential manner due to the wide and intensive sharing of variables by all parts of the system. We propose a distributed solution where processes communicate only through messages with their neighbors; there are no shared variables and there is no central process for message routing or process scheduling. Deadlock is avoided in this system despite the absence of global control. Each process in the solution requires only a limited amount of memory. The correctness of a distributed system is proven by proving the correctness of each of its component processes and then using inductive arguments. The proposed solution has been empirically found to be efficient in preliminary studies. The paper presents formal, detailed proofs of correctness.",

We study this model in the presence of dataflow constraints between the tasks within a group (intragroup dependencies), and between tasks in different groups (inter-group dependencies). We consider two natural semantics for dataflow constraints, namely, RTW (real-time workshop) semantics and LET (logical execution time) semantics. We show that while RTW semantics offers better end-to-end latency on the task group level, LET semantics allows tighter resource bounds in the abstraction hierarchy and therefore provides better composability properties. This result holds both for intragroup and intergroup dependencies, as well as for shared and for distributed resources",

This paper describes the Open Control Platform (OCP), which is a key element of SEC. OCP provides the enabling software infrastructure that will facilitate the transitioning of controls designs to embedded targets. OCP enables controls designer to focus on the control technology instead of on the software technology needed to transition designs to real-time embedded platforms. The OCP is being developed by the Embedded Systems Research Team within the Boeing Phantom Works Open Systems organization. Assisting Boeing in these efforts are the Georgia Institute of Technology, Honeywell Labs and the University of California Berkeley. The OCP is being delivered to a host of university and industrial researchers who are participating in the SEC program.",

            "abstract" : "In interface-based design, components are described by a component interface. In contrast to a component description that describes what a component does, a component interface describes how a component can be used, and a well designed component interface provides enough information to decide whether two or more components can work together properly in a system. Real-Time Interfaces expand the idea of interfacebased design to the area of real-time system design, where the term of working together properly refers to questions like: Does the composed system satisfy all requested real-time properties such as delay and throughput constraints? In this work, we extend the theory of Real-Time Interfaces and prove its applicability for the design of systems with hierarchical scheduling. We introduce a component system for interface-based design of systems with mixed FP, RM and EDF scheduling. We then further extend the ability for hierarchic scheduling by introducing server components. The introduced component system with Real-Time Interfaces not only allows interface-based design of complex real-time systems with hierarchical scheduling, but also inherently enables detailed schedulability analysis of such systems.",

Two complementary trends have resulted in the creation of smart environments that integrate information, communication, and sensing technologies into everyday objects. We distinguish between two types of smart artifacts: system-oriented, importunate smartness and people-oriented, empowering smartness. The system-oriented and people-oriented approaches represent the end points of a line along which we can position weighted combinations of both types of smartness depending on the application domain.

The notable advantage of this is that applications as well as their environment can be adapted proactively based on knowledge about future tasks.

This approach allows anyone to access embedded devices through a Web application, via a standard Web browser. This Web of Things requires to embed Web servers in hardware-constrained devices. We first analyze the traffics embedded Web servers have to handle. Starting from this analysis, we propose a new way to design embedded Web servers, using a dedicated TCP/IP stack and numerous cross-layer off-line pre-calculation (where information are shared between IP, TCP, HTTP and the Web application). We finally present a prototype -- named Smews -- as a proof of concept of our proposals. It has been embedded in tiny devices (smart cards, sensors and other embedded devices), with a requirement of only 200~bytes of RAM and 7~kilo-bytes of code. We show that it is significantly faster than other state of the art solutions. We made Smews source code publically available under an open-source license.",

In this paper, we propose a platform that enables people to share their Web-enabled devices so that others can use them. We illustrate how to rely on existing social networks and their open APIs (e.g. OpenSocial) to enable owners to leverage the social structures in place for sharing smart things with others. We finally discuss some of the challenges we identified towards a composable Web of Things.",

Based on the analysis on the basic and essential characters of IoT, this paper deals with Future IoT architecture in two aspects: Unit IoT and Ubiquitous IoT. Focusing on a special application, the architecture of the Unit IoT is built from man like neural network (MLN) model and its modified model. Ubiquitous IoT refers to the global IoT or the integration of multiple Unit IoTs with ubiquitous characters, and its architecture employs social organization framework (SOF) model. The models for Future IoT are not only helpful to interpret the relationship between IoT and reality world, but also beneficial to the implementation of IoT in its current development milieu.",

It describes the development of a data reference model using IDEFIX data modelling language and a step-by-step approach to identify and collect required data quickly. The purpose of this reference model is to describe the interaction between various data groups relating to items such as parts, resources and some aspects of system logic. This model has been developed and refined using data collected from real industrial situations. The model encapsulates the major entities (data groups) with their attributes and relationships. This model was then translated into a normalised relational database. Having developed the data model, a step-by-step approach was devised to support simulation practitioners. The reference model has been annotated with the sources of real data, so that practitioners could identify the most suitable source of data for their requirements.",

In this application, the simulation is used not only as an analysis and evaluation tool, but also as a task generator for the specification of shop floor control tasks. Using this approach, the effort applied to the development of the simulation is not duplicated in the development of the control system. Instead, the same control logic is used for the control system as was used for the simulation. Additionally, since the simulation implements the control, it provides very high fidelity performance predictions. Implementation experience in two flexible manufacturing laboratories is described. These implementations use a special feature of the Arena/SIMAN simulation language which allows Arena/SIMAN to interact directly with the shop floor control system through an interprocess communication mechanism. This feature is described in detail.",

This rule is easy to implement and has strong intuitive appeal. Given a finite sequence with an arbitrary initial condition, the rule is also optimal, in the sense that it minimizes the width of the marginal confidence interval about the truncated sample mean. We illustrate the performance of the rule by applying it to output generated by multiple runs of four queueing simulations. Models and run conditions provide the test sequences for which truncation is contraindicated, test sequences exhibiting positive and negative initialization bias, and test sequences which are entirely transient. Results demonstrate that the rule is efficient, effective, and consistent with the conflicting objectives of mitigating initialization bias while preserving information.",

            "abstract" : "This paper addresses the problem of understanding the shape of the locomotor trajectories for a human being walking in an empty space to reach a goal defined both in position and in direction. Among all the possible trajectories reaching a given goal what are the fundamental reasons to chose one trajectory instead of another? The underlying idea to attack this question has been to relate this problem to an optimal control problem: the trajectory is chosen according to some optimization principle. This is our basic starting assumption. The subject being viewed as a controlled system, the question becomes what criteria is optimized? Is it the time to perform the trajectory? the length of the path? the minimum jerk along the path?... In this study we show that the human locomotor trajectories are well approximated by the geodesics of a differential system minimizing the L<sub>2</sub> norm of the control. Such geodesics are made of arcs of clothoids. The clothoid or Cornu spiral is a curve, whose curvature grows with the distance from the origin. The study is based on an experimental protocol involving 7 subjects. They had to walk within a motion capture room from a fixed starting point, and to cross over distant porches from which both position in the room and orientation were changing over trials.",

            "abstract" : "Studies of locomotion in virtual environments assume that correct geometric principles define the relationship between walking speed and environmental flow. However, we have observed that geometrically correct optic flow appears to be too slow during simulated locomotion on a treadmill. Experiment 1 documents the effect in a head-mounted display. Experiment 2 shows that the effect is eliminated when the gaze is directed downward or to the side, or when the walking speed is slow. Experiment 3 shows that the effect is unchanged by stride length. Experiment 4 verifies that the effect is not attributable to image jitter. The change in perceived speed from straight ahead to side or down gaze coincides with a shift from expanding optic flow to lamellar flow. Therefore, we hypothesize that lamellar flow is necessary for accurate speed perception, and that a limited field of view eliminates this cue during straight-ahead gaze.",

We present a novel behavioral model of path planning that extends previous models through its significant use of pedestrian performance statistics that were obtained during a suite of experiments. We develop an original interpretation of quantitative metrics for measuring a models accuracy, and use it to compare our path planning approach to a popular contemporary method.

            "abstract" : "Immersive spaces such as 4-sided displays with stereo viewing and high-quality tracking provide a very engaging and realistic virtual experience. However, walking is inherently limited by the restricted physical space, both due to the screens (limited translation) and the missing back screen (limited rotation). In this paper, we propose three novel locomotion techniques that have three concurrent goals: keep the user safe from reaching the translational and rotational boundaries; increase the amount of real walking and finally, provide a more enjoyable and ecological interaction paradigm compared to traditional controller-based approaches. We notably introduce the Virtual Companion, which uses a small bird to guide the user through VEs larger than the physical space. We evaluate the three new techniques through a user study with travel-to-target and path following tasks. The study provides insight into the relative strengths of each new technique for the three aforementioned goals. Specifically, if speed and accuracy are paramount, traditional controller interfaces augmented with our novel warning techniques may be more appropriate; if physical walking is more important, two of our paradigms (extended Magic Barrier Tape and Constrained Wand) should be preferred; last, fun and ecological criteria would favor the Virtual Companion.",

            "abstract" : "This paper describes experiments regarding navigation performance using a new locomotion interface for walking through virtual space. Although traveling on foot is the most intuitive style of locomotion, proprioceptive feedback from walking is not provided in most applications of virtual environments. We developed an infinite surface driven by actuators for enabling a sense of walking. Torus-shaped surfaces are selected to realize the locomotion interface. The device employs twelve sets of treadmills, connected side by side and driven in perpendicular directions. The virtual infinite surface is generated by the motion of the treadmills. A walker can go in any direction while his/her position is fixed in the real world. The device is called a <italic>Torus Treadmill.</italic> Navigation performance was measured by path-reproduction tests. Subjects were immersed in a virtual grass-covered plain on which a cone-shaped target object was placed. The subjects first traveled to the target object. After they reached it, the target object disappeared and the rehomed subjects were asked to return to the place where the target object was placed. We also set two target objects, and the subject traveled along a bent path. We compared two locomotion modes: walking on the Torus Treadmill and moving purely by joystick operation. The results of the bent-path experiment showed that the accuracy of the path reproduction in the Torus Treadmill mode is better than that of joystick mode.",

We explore the effect of being able to see ones own body in such systems on an objective measure of the accuracy of one form of space perception. Using an action-based response measure, we found that participants who explored near space while seeing a fully-articulated and tracked visual representation of themselves subsequently made more accurate judgments of absolute egocentric distance to locations ranging from 4 m to 6 m away from where they were standing than did participants who saw no avatar. A nonanimated avatar also improved distance judgments, but by a lesser amount. Participants who viewed either animated or static avatars positioned 3 m in front of their own position made subsequent distance judgments with similar accuracy to the participants who viewed the equivalent animated or static avatar positioned at their own location. We discuss the implications of these results on theories of embodied perception in virtual environments.",

The knowledge of these principles is useful to implement biologically inspired path planning algorithms on a humanoid robot. The key is to formulate the path planning problem as optimal control problem. We propose a single dynamic model valid for all situations, unifying nonholonomic and holonomic parts of the motion, as well as a carefully designed unified objective function. The choice between holonomic and nonholonomic behavior appears, along with the optimal path, as result of the optimization by powerful numerical techniques. The proposed model and objective function are successfully tested in six different locomotion scenarios. The resulting paths are implemented on the HRP2 robot in the simulation environment OpenHRP as well as in the experiment on the real robot.",

In both a computer-generated environment and a corresponding real environment, study participants walked to targets on walls and stopped as close to them as they could without making contact. In each of five experimental conditions participants used a combination of one of three locomotion interfaces (really walking, walking-in-place, and joystick flying), and one of three visual conditions (head-mounted display, unrestricted natural vision, or field-of-view-restricted natural vision). We identified metrics and collected data that captured task performance and the underlying kinematics of the task. Our results show: 1) Over 95% of the variance in simple motion paths is captured in three critical values: peak velocity; when, in the course of a motion, the peak velocity occurs; and peak deceleration. 2) Correlations of those critical value data for the conditions taken pairwise suggest a coarse ordering of locomotion interfaces by naturalness. 3) Task performance varies with interface condition, but correlations of that value for conditions taken pairwise do not cluster by naturalness. 4) The perceptual variable, r (also known as the time-to-contact) calculated at the point of peak deceleration has higher correlation with task performance than r calculated at peak velocity.",

This asymmetric bi-manual interface is an alternative to commonly used keyboard and mouse input, where the non-dominant hand assists the dominant hand with keystroke input to toggle modes. Our first study compared the keyboard and mouse interface to bi-manual interfaces using the 3D input devices SpaceTraveller and Globefish in a coarse spatial orientation task requiring egocentric and exocentric viewpoint navigation. The different interface configurations performed similarly with respect to task completion times, but the bi-manual techniques resulted in significantly less errors. This result is likely to be due to better workload balancing between the two hands allowing the user to focus on a single task for each hand. Our second study focused on a bi-manual 3D point selection task, which required the selection of small targets and good depth perception. The Globefish interface employing position control for rotations performed significantly better than the SpaceTraveller interface for this task.",

We define a new 3D interaction technique, called multiscale interaction, which links users scale of perception and their scale of interaction. The technique exploits users physical navigation in the 3D space in front of a large high-resolution display, using it to explicitly control scale of interaction, in addition to scale of perception. Other interaction techniques for large displays have not previously considered physical navigation to this degree. We identify the design space of the technique, which other researchers can continue to explore and build on, and evaluate one implementation of multiscale interaction to begin to quantify the benefits of the technique. We show evidence of a natural psychological link between scale of perception and scale of interaction and that exploiting it as an explicit control in the user interface can be beneficial to users in problem solving tasks. In addition, we show that designing against this philosophy can be detrimental.",

            "abstract" : "Many constrained interfaces are designed to be simpler than the real world by restricting movement, limiting interface actions, and keeping interface objects in a plane. However, the strong utility of pure 3D interfaces for medical, architectural, product design, and scientific visualization means that interface design for pure 3D remains an important challenge. An intriguing possibility is that enhanced 3D interfaces might offer simpler navigation, more compelling functionality, safer movements, and less occlusion, than 3D reality, especially for information exploration and visualization tasks. Such features can enable superhuman capabilities such as faster-than-light teleportation, flying through objects, and X-ray vision. Enhanced 3D interfaces might have supernatural tools such as magic wands for instantly shrinking, enlarging, duplicating, or sending objects and enchanted environments that provide error prevention, history keeping, and programming-by-demonstration. Playful game designers and creative application developers have already pushed the technology further than those who seek merely to mimic reality. Advanced designs are marked by their support of rapid situation awareness through effective overviews, reduced numbers of actions to accomplish tasks; and prompt, meaningful feedback for user actions. This article reviews these clever enhanced 3D-design features and encourages approaches that facilitate user tasks rather than mimic reality.",

It is based on a hybrid position/rate control which enables both accurate interaction and coarse positioning in a large VE.

When the cursor is located inside the bubble, its motion is position-controlled. When the cursor is outside, it is rate-controlled. The user may also feel the inner surface of the bubble, since the spherical workspace is haptically displayed by applying an elastic force-feedback when crossing the surface of the bubble.",

            "abstract" : "This work presents a differential system which accurately describes the geometry of human locomotor trajectories of humans walking on the ground level, in absence of obstacles. Our approach emphasizes the close relationship between the shape of the locomotor paths in goal-directed movements and the simplified kinematic model of a wheeled mobile robot. This kind of system has been extensively studied in robotics community. From a kinematic perspective, the characteristic of this wheeled robot is the nonholonomic constraint of the wheels on the floor, which forces the vehicle to move tangentially to its main axis. Humans do not walk sideways. This obvious observation indicates that some constraints (mechanical, anatomical...) act on human bodies restricting the way humans generate locomotor trajectories. To model this, we propose a differential system that respects nonholonomic constraints. We validate this model by comparing simulated trajectories with actual (recorded) trajectories produced during goal-oriented locomotion in humans. Subjects had to start from a pre-defined position and direction to cross over a distant porch (position and orientation of the porch were the two manipulated factors). Such comparative analysis is undertaken by making use of numerical methods to compute the control inputs from actual trajectories. Three body frames have been considered: head, pelvis and trunk. It appears that the trunk can be considered as a kind of a steering wheel that steers the human body with a delay of around 0.2 second. This model has been validated on a database of 1,560 trajectories recorded from seven subjects. It opens a promising route to better understand the human locomotion via differential geometry tools successfully experienced in mobile robotics",

            "abstract" : "This paper investigates the use of camera motions, in order to improve the sensation of walking in a Virtual Environment. A simple model of camera motion is first proposed. This model uses: (1) oscillating motions for the position of the camera, and (2) a compensation motion which changes the orientation of the camera and simulate oculomotor compensation to keep a constant focal point when walking. Then we describe two experiments which were conducted to study the characteristics of our model and the preference of the users in terms of sensation of walking. The first experiment compared the use of oscillating camera motions along the three directions of space. The oscillating motions were all preferred to the control condition (i.e. a linear motion, as if the user was driving a car). Furthermore, the participants preferred oscillating motions along the vertical axis, compared with the two other directions of space. The second experiment was focused on the use of a compensation motion. It showed that on average participants preferred a compensated motion during the walk, as compared with a motion with a constant orientation of the camera. These results are consistent with the way our body and eyes move naturally when walking in real life. Taken together, our results suggest that camera motions can considerably improve the sensation of walking in virtual environments. Camera motions could be further introduced in numerous applications of virtual reality in which the simulation of walking is important, such as: architectural visits, training simulations, or videogames.",

            "abstract" : "Telepresent walking allows visits to remote places such as museums, exhibitions, architecture, or industrial sites with a high degree of realism. While walking freely around in the user environment, the user sees the remote environment through the &#8220;eyes&#8221; of a remote mobile teleoperator. For that purpose, the users motion is tracked and transferred to the teleoperator. Without additional processing of the motion data, the size of the remote environment to be explored is limited to the size of the user environment. This paper proposes an extension of telepresent walking to arbitrarily large remote or virtual spaces based on compressing wide-area motion into the available user space. Motion compression is a novel approach and does not make use of scaling or walking-in-place metaphors. Rather, motion compression introduces some deviation of curvature between user motion and teleoperator motion. An optimization approach is used to find the user path of minimum curvature deviation with respect to a given predicted teleoperator path that fits inside the boundaries of the user environment. Turning angles and travel distan ces are mapped with a 1:1 ratio to provide the desired impression of realistic selflocomotion in the teleoperators environment. The effects of the curvature deviation on inconsistent perception of locomotion are studied in two experiments.",

A second experiment, in which two subjects were tested at 10 degrees , 40 degrees , and 120 degrees FOV, used a time-invariant plant to allow the measurement of human describing-function parameters. The crossover frequency, increased at least 5% and the RMS error dropped by at least 20% at a FOV of 40 degrees or 120 degrees compared to 10 degrees . The results from these two experiments show that a FOV as small as 40 degrees can produce performance improvements of the same magnitude as a FOV as large as 120 degrees . In the final experiment, where only the central 10 degrees of the scene rotated, performance was unexpectedly best at 10 degrees and poorest at 40 degrees and 80 degrees .",

However, the principal factors that are responsible for this phenomenon have remained largely unidentified. In this paper we shed some new light on this intriguing problem by reporting the results of two recent experiments in which we assess egocentric distance perception in a high fidelity, low latency, immersive virtual environment that represents an exact virtual replica of the participant&#146;s concurrently occupied real environment. Under these novel conditions, we make the startling discovery that distance perception appears not to be significantly compressed in the immersive virtual environment, relative to in the real world.",

            "title" : "Elucidating Factors that can Facilitate Veridical Spatial Perception in Immersive Virtual Environments",
            "abstract" : "Enabling veridical spatial perception in immersive virtual environments (IVEs) is an important yet elusive goal, as even the factors implicated in the often-reported phenomenon of apparent distance compression in HMD-based IVEs have yet to be satisfactorily elucidated. In recent experiments (Interrante et al., 2006), we have found that participants appear less prone to significantly underestimate egocentric distances in HMD-based IVEs, relative to in the real world, in the special case that they unambiguously know, through first-hand observation, that the presented virtual environment is a high fidelity 3D model of their concurrently occupied real environment. We had hypothesized that this increased veridicality might be due to participants having a stronger sensation of presence in the IVE under these conditions of co-location, which state of mind leads them to act on their visual input in the IVE similarly as they would in the real world (the presence hypothesis). However, alternative hypotheses are also possible. Primary among these is the visual calibration hypothesis: participants could be relying on metric information gleaned from their exposure to the real environment to calibrate their judgments of sizes and distances in the matched virtual environment. It is important to disambiguate between the presence and visual calibration hypotheses because they suggest different directions for efforts to facilitate veridical distance perception in general (non-co-located) IVEs. In this paper, we present the results of an experiment that seeks novel insight into this question. Using a mixed within- and between-subjects design, we compare participants relative ability to accurately estimate egocentric distances in three different virtual environment models: one that is an identical match to the occupied real environment; one in which each of the walls in our virtual room model has been surreptitiously moved ~10% inward towards the center of the room; and one in which each of the walls has been surreptitiously moved ~10% outwards from the center of the room. If the visual calibration hypothesis holds, then we should expect to see a degradation in the accuracy of peoples distance judgments in the surreptitiously modified models, manifested as an underestimation of distances when the IVE is actually larger than the real room and as an overestimation of distances when the IVE is smaller. However, what we found is that distances were significantly underestimated in the virtual environment relative to in the real world in each of the surreptitiously modified room environments, while remaining reasonably accurate (consistent with our previous findings) in the case of the faithfully size-matched room environment. In a post-test survey, participants in each of the three room size conditions reported equivalent subjective levels of presence and did not indicate any overt awareness of the room size manipulation",

            "abstract" : "In this paper, we revisit the cells-and-portals visibility methods, originally developed for the special case of architectural interiors. We define an effectiveness measure for a cells-and-portals partitioning, and introduce a two-pass algorithm that computes a cells-and-portals partition. The algorithm uses a simple heuristic that creates short portals as a mean for generating an effective partition. The input to the algorithm is a set of half edges in 2D that can be extracted from a complex polygonal model. The first pass of the algorithm creates an initial partition, which is then refined by the second pass. We show that our method creates a partition that is more effective than the common BSP partition, even when the latter is further refined with the application of our second pass. Our cells-and-portals algorithm is designed to deal with arbitrarily oriented walls. The algorithm also supports outdoor scenes, where the vertical walls of the buildings served as occluders and portals are extended above the buildings. We show that the extended portals allow an output-sensitive rendering of large urban scenes. Finally, since our two-pass method is fully automatic and local, it supports incremental changes of the model by locally recomputing and updating the partition. We call our method Breaking the Walls (BW) since it breaks out of indoor scenes to outdoor scenes, and allows walls to be broken interactively, with an instant updating of the partition.",

Techniques proposed to lift this size constraint, enabling real walking in VEs that are larger than the tracked lab space, all require reorientation techniques (ROTs) in the worst-case situation-when a user is close to walking out of the tracked space. We propose a new ROT using distractors-objects in the VE for the user to focus on while the VE rotates and compare our method to current ROTs through two user studies. Our findings show ROTs using distractors were preferred and ranked more natural by users. Users were also less aware of the rotating VE, when ROTs with distractors were used.",

            "abstract" : "Traveling through immersive virtual environments (IVEs) by means of real walking is an important activity to increase naturalness of VR-based interaction. However, the size of the virtual world often exceeds the size of the tracked space so that a straightforward implementation of omni-directional and unlimited walking is not possible. Redirected walking is one concept to solve this problem of walking in IVEs by inconspicuously guiding the user on a physical path that may differ from the path the user visually perceives. When the user approaches a virtual object she can be redirected to a real proxy object that is registered to the virtual counterpart and provides passive haptic feedback. In such passive haptic environments, any number of virtual objects can be mapped to proxy objects having similar haptic properties, e.g., size, shape and texture. The user can sense a virtual object by touching its real world counterpart. Redirecting a user to a registered proxy object makes it necessary to predict the users intended position in the IVE. Based on this target position we determine a path through the physical space such that the user is guided to the registered proxy object. We present a taxonomy of possible redirection techniques that enable user guidance such that inconsistencies between visual and proprioceptive stimuli are imperceptible.We describe how a users target in the virtual world can be predicted reliably and how a corresponding real-world path to the registered proxy object can be derived.",

            "abstract" : "In order to increase a users sense of presence in an artificial environment some researchers propose a gradual transition from reality to the virtual world instead of immersing users into the virtual world directly. One approach is to start the VR experience in a virtual replica of the physical space to accustom users to the characteristics of VR, e.g., latency, reduced field of view or tracking errors, in a known environment. Although this procedure is already applied in VR demonstrations, until now it has not been verified whether the usage of such a transitional environment - as transition between real and virtual environment - increases someones sense of presence. We have observed subjective, physiological and behavioral reactions of subjects during a fully-immersive flight phobia experiment under two different conditions: the virtual flight environment was displayed immediately, or subjects visited a transitional environment before entering the virtual flight environment. We have quantified to what extent a gradual transition to the VE via a transitional environment increases the level of presence. We have found that subjective responses show significantly higher scores for the users sense of presence, and that subjects behavioral reactions change when a transitional environment is shown first. Considering physiological reactions, no significant difference could be found.",

            "abstract" : "The World In Miniature (WIM) technique has effectively allowed users to interact and travel efficiently in Virtual Environments. However, WIM fails to work in worlds with tasks at various levels of scale. Such an example is using the WIM to arrange furniture and then leaving the room to travel the city using the WIM for navigation and wayfinding. To address this problem, scaling and scrolling were added to the WIM to create the Scaled Scrolling World In Miniature (SSWIM). The interface and testbed were iteratively created under expert evaluation and multiple formative user evaluations led to the final design. The WIM and SSWIM were then compared inside three differently sized cities by users who located a sphere and traveled into it to read the label at the sphere&#146;s center. Users were administered two standard psychology tests to account for spatial orientation (Cube Comparison Test) and spatial scanning (Maze Tracing Test) factors. The results show that the SSWIM&#146;s added functionality, and hence complexity, caused no significant hit in user performance and additionally that users were able to use SSWIM effectively after a short instructional period. To better understand the effect of experience, a follow-up experiment was performed showing performance plateaued after ten to fifteen minutes of use.",

The task was to answer a set of questions based on Crooks condensation of Blooms taxonomy to assess the participants cognition of a virtual room with respect to knowledge, understanding and application, and higher mental processes. Participants were also asked to draw a sketch map of the testing virtual environment and the objects within it. Users sense of presence was measured using the Steed-Usoh-Slater presence questionnaire. Our results suggest that for applications where problem solving and interpretation of material is important, or where opportunity to train is minimal, then having a large tracked space so that the participant can physically walk around the virtual environment provides benefits over common virtual travel techniques.",

Up to this point, all research in this area has focused on building interiors and urban environments which are significantly different from natural environments in terms of navigation cues and useful wayfinding techniques. The experiment we present uses a virtual environment, as compared to a map only or real-world conditions on navigation tasks in a natural environment. We show that navigation ability is more important to performance than the training method, with the virtual environment being most effective for intermediate orienteers as compared to advanced or beginner orienteers.",

The application of torso forces is necessary to provide missing inertial forces during acceleration on a treadmill and to stop a user from walking through virtual walls. Torso forces can also substitute for treadmill tilt, as has been validated by psychological, biomechanical and energetic studies. A harness has been designed to transmit forces to the torso with minimum backlash while maintaining comfort. The experience of locomotion is integrated into a virtual environment comprised of a CAVE-like visual display and head-tracked stereo sound synthesis. To complete the multi-sensory experience, atmospheric and olfactory displays are under development.",

            "abstract" : "Locomotion in virtual environments (VEs) remains one of the major problems in current virtual reality research. The most intuitive way to move about the real world is to travel on foot. People often feel a better sense of distance or direction while walking than while riding in a vehicle. This article discusses the development of a locomotion device that provides a sense of walking. In terms of natural interaction, the physical exertion of walking proves essential to locomotion. The research of my colleagues and I aims to give users a sense of walking while their position remains localized in the physical world. Weve developed several prototypes of interface devices for walking. From the results of our research, we concluded that an infinite surface would offer an ideal means for giving people a sense of walking. Our device, called the Torus Treadmill, uses a torus-shaped surface to realize the locomotion interface. The surface employs 12 sets of treadmills connected side-by-side and driven in a perpendicular direction. These treadmills generate an infinite surface. We measured the motion of the users feet with magnetic sensors. The floor moves in the opposite direction of the walker, canceling the motion of each step. The walkers position remains localized in the real world by this computer-controlled motion of the floor. The walker can freely change direction. An image of the virtual space appears in a head-mounted display corresponding to the walkers virtual position.",

The goal is to allow the user to move through virtual environments in as similar a manner as possible to walking through the real world. We approach this problem by examining the interrelationships between motion control and the other actions people use to act, sense, and react to their environment. If the interactions between control actions and sensory feedback can be made comparable to those of actions in the real world, then there is hope for constructing an effective new technique. Candidate solutions are reviewed once the analysis is developed. This analysis leads to a promising new design for a sensor-based virtual locomotion called <italic>Gaiter.</italic> The new control allows users to direct their movement through virtual environments by stepping in place. The movement of a persons legs is sensed, and in-place walking is treated as a gesture indicating the user intends to take a virtual step. More specifically, the movement of the users legs determines the direction, extent, and timing of their movement through virtual environments. Tying virtual locomotion to leg motion allows a person to step in any direction and control the stride length and cadence of his virtual steps. The user can walk straight, turn in place, and turn while advancing. Motion is expressed in a body-centric coordinate system similar to that of actual stepping. The system can discriminate between gestural and actual steps, so both types of steps can be intermixed.",

            "abstract" : "A telepresence system enables a user in a local environment to maneuver in a remote or virtual space through a robotic operator (agent). In order to ensure a high degree of telepresence realism, it is critical that the local user has the ability to control the remote agents movement through the users own locomotion. The required motion of the remote agent is determined according to its environment and the specific task it is to perform. The local users environment is usually different from that of the remote agent in terms of the shapes and dimensions. A motion mapping is needed from the remote agent to the local user to ensure the similarity of the paths in the two environments. In particular, the terminal position of the local user after a segment of movement is also an important portion in such a motion mapping. This paper progressively addresses these issues from the optimization point of view. Two strategies are suggested for solving the motion mapping problem for the single user case. The resulting solutions are then extended to the multiuser case where several local users share a local environment to control different remote agents. Extensive simulations and comparisons show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",

            "abstract" : "In two experiments, subjects traveled through virtual mazes, encountering target objects along the way. Their task was to indicate the direction to these target objects from a terminal location in the maze (from which the objects could no longer be seen). Subjects controlled their motion through the mazes using three locomotion modes. In the Walk mode, subjects walked normally in the experimental room. For each subject, body position and heading were tracked, and the tracking information was used to continuously update the visual imagery presented to the subjects on a head-mounted display. This process created the impression of immersion in the experimental maze. In the Visual Turn mode subjects moved through the environment using a joystick to control their turning. The only sensory information subjects received about rotation and translation was that provided by the computer-generated imagery. The Real Turn mode was midway between the other two modes, in that subjects physically turned in place to steer while translating in the virtual maze; thus translation through the maze was signaled only by the computer-generated imagery, whereas rotations were signaled by the imagery as well as by proprioceptive and vestibular information. The dependent measure in the experiment was the absolute error of the subjects directional estimate to each target from the terminal location. Performance in the Walk mode was significantly better than in the Visual Turn mode but other trends were not significant. A secondary finding was that the degree of motion sickness depended upon locomotion mode, with the lowest incidence occurring in the Walk mode. Both findings suggest the advisability of having subjects explore virtual environments using real rotations and translations in tasks involving spatial orientation.",

We report the results of an experiment in which groups were trained in six different environments (no training, real world, map, VE desktop, VE immersive, and VE long immersive) and then were asked to apply route and configurational knowledge in a real-world maze environment. Short periods of VE training were no more effective than map training; however with sufficient exposure to the virtual training environment, VE training eventually surpassed real-world training.

Although research provides converging evidence that users of virtual environments can experience motion sickness, there have been no controlled studies to determine to what extent the users subjective response is a demand characteristic resulting from pre and posttest measures. In this study, subjects were given either SSQs both pre and postvirtual environment immersion, or only postimmersion. This technique tested for contrast effects due to demand characteristics in which administration of the questionnaire itself suggested to the participant that the virtual environment may produce motion sickness. Results indicate that reports of motion sickness after immersion in a virtual environment are much greater when both pre and postquestionnaires are given than when only a posttest questionnaire is used.

            "abstract" : "Omni-directional locomotion systems are yet of little advantage in virtual environments (VEs) with limited large display systems, where users may experience visual-less situations when they move in a direction that is not covered by the large screen. This paper presents a new omni-directional locomotion interface based on step-in-place movement and a smart-turntable system to impart users with the ability to move freely in any direction within VEs without loosing sight of the displayed image despite its projection on a limited large screen that does not provide surrounding or 360/spl deg/ visual feedback. The novelty of the interface is that: (a) it uses a smart-turntable with embedded sensors as a walking platform that compensate users rotations rather than their displacements; (b) no cable attachments are made to the user body; and (c) the user can make many full body rotations without loosing sight of the environment, virtually providing a surrounding display despite the use of the limited size screen.",

However, preventing visual avatar interpenetration causes discrepancy between visual and proprioceptive cues. We investigated users detection thresholds for visual interpenetration (the depth at which they see that two objects have interpenetrated) and sensory discrepancy (the displacement at which they notice mismatched visual and proprioceptive cues). We found that users are much less sensitive to visual-proprioceptive conflict than they are to visual interpenetration.

By basing the virtual avatar motion on the speed of the users heel motion while walking in place, we create a direct mapping from foot-motion to locomotion that is responsive, intuitive, and easy to implement. In this paper, we describe the technique, analyze its starting and stopping latency, and provide experimental results on the suppression of false steps and general usability of the system.",

How significant are these distortions for spatial perception in virtual reality? In this study, we used a helmet-mounted display and a mechanical head tracker to investigate the tolerance to errors between head motions and the resulting visual display. The relationship between the head movement and the associated updating of the visual display was adjusted by subjects until the image was judged as stable relative to the world. Both rotational and translational movements were tested, and the relationship between the movements and the direction of gravity was varied systematically. Typically, for the display to be judged as stable, subjects needed the visual world to be moved in the opposite direction to the head movement by an amount greater than the head movement itself, during both rotational and translational head movements, although a large range of movement was tolerated and judged as appearing stable. These results suggest that it not necessary to model the visual geometry accurately and suggest circumstances when tracker drift can be corrected by jumps in the display which will pass unnoticed by the user.",

            "abstract" : "Even in state-of-the-art virtual reality (VR) setups, participants often feel lost when navigating through virtual environments. In psychological experiments, such disorientation is often compensated for by extensive training. The current study investigated participants sense of direction by means of a rapid point-to-origin task without any training or performance feedback. This allowed us to study participants intuitive spatial orientation in VR while minimizing the influence of higher cognitive abilities and compensatory strategies. After visually displayed passive excursions along one-or two-segment trajectories, participants were asked to point back to the origin of locomotion as accurately and quickly as possible. Despite using a high-quality video projection with a 84deg times 63deg field of view, participants overall performance was rather poor. Moreover, six of the 16 participants exhibited striking qualitative errors, i.e., consistent left-right confusions that have not been observed in comparable real world experiments. Taken together, this study suggests that even an immersive high-quality video projection system is not necessarily sufficient for enabling natural spatial orientation in VR. We propose that a rapid point-to-origin paradigm can be a useful tool for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of VR setups in terms of enabling natural and unencumbered spatial orientation and performance.",

The peer is controlled through a combination of reactive controllers that determine the gross motion of the virtual bicycle, action-based controllers that animate the virtual bicyclist and generate verbal behaviors, and a keyboard interface that allows an experimenter to initiate the virtual bicyclists actions during the course of an experiment. The virtual bicyclists repertoire of behaviors includes road following, riding alongside the human rider, stopping at intersections, and crossing intersections through specified gaps. The virtual cyclist engages the human subject through gaze, gesture, and verbal interactions. We describe the structure of the behavior code and report the results of a pilot study examining how 10- and 12-year-old children interact with a peer cyclist. Results of the pilot study showed that the presence of the peer had a significant influence on the size of the gaps taken as well as time left to spare between the participant and the trailing car in the crossed gap.",

The experiment was designed and implemented in the context of a formal framework for the design and evaluation of VE travel techniques. Subjects traveled through virtual corridors, noting the location of objects along the way, and were asked to point in the direction of one of these objects when the end of the corridor was reached. Results indicate that virtual travel techniques, in which users do not physically translate their bodies, can allow the maintenance of a users spatial orientation as measured by a pointing task. The experiment also replicates an earlier result, showing that path dimension significantly affects user performance. Finally, the strategies used by subjects to perform the task were shown to be significant, indicating that performance depends not only on the technique, environment, and task, but also on the sophistication of the user.",

            "abstract" : "This paper reports on a study that compares three different methods of travel in a complex, multi-level virtual environment using a between-subjects design. A real walking travel technique was compared to two common virtual travel techniques. Participants explored a two-story 3D maze at their own pace and completed four post-tests requiring them to remember different aspects of the environment. Testing tasks included recall of objects from the environment, recognition of objects present and not present, sketching of maps, and placing objects on a map. We also analyzed task completion time and collision data captured during the experiment session. Participants that utilized the real walking technique were able to place more objects correctly on a map, completed the maze faster, and experienced fewer collisions with the environment. While none of the conditions outperformed each other on any other tests, our results indicate that for tasks involving the naive exploration of a complex, multi-level 3D environment, the real walking technique supports a more efficient exploration than common virtual travel techniques. While there was a consistent trend of better performance on our measures for the real walking technique, it is not clear from our data that the benefits of real walking in these types of environments always justify the cost and space trade-offs of maintaining a wide-area tracking system",

Unlike the control mappings of a conventional gamepad, Pointman allows users to specify their direction of movement independently from the heading of the upper body. The motivation for this work is to develop a virtual infantry training simulator that is inexpensive, portable, and allows the user to execute realistic tactical infantry movements. Tactical movements rely heavily on the ability to scan while moving along a path, which requires the ability to independently coordinate course and heading. Conventional gamepad control mappings confound course and heading, and facilitate moving sideways and spiraling toward or away from targets. Pointman was derived from an analysis of how people move and coordinate actions in the real and virtual worlds",

The paper presents a method of implementing a new interface device for locomotion in virtual space. The walker wears omni directional sliding devices on the feet, which generate the feel of walking while the position of the walker is fixed in the physical world. A hoop is set around the walkers waist, by which the position of the walker is limited. The walker can freely change the direction of walking in the hoop. The scene of virtual space is displayed in a head mounted display, corresponding with the motion of the feet and head. Usability of the system is tested by 235 novice users at SIGGRAPH95. 94% of the participants could walk freely around the virtual space.",

We divide most user-interaction tasks into three categories: navigation, selection/manipulation, and system control. Throughout the paper, our focus is on presenting not only the available techniques but also practical guidelines for 3-D interaction design and widely held myths.

Both VEs were &#8220;virtual buildings&#8221; containing more than seventy rooms. Participants using the HMD navigated the buildings significantly more quickly and developed a significantly more accurate sense of relative straight-line distance. There was no significant difference between the two types of display in terms of the distance that participants traveled or the mean accuracy of their direction estimates. Behavioral analyses showed that participants took advantage of the natural, head-tracked interface provided by the HMD in ways that included &#8220;looking around&#8221; more often while traveling through the VEs, and spending less time stationary in the VEs while choosing a direction in which to travel.",

            "abstract" : "This paper describes a methodology based on human judgments of memory awareness states for assessing the simulation fidelity of a virtual environment (VE) in relation to its real scene counterpart. To demonstrate the distinction between task performance-based approaches and additional human evaluation of cognitive awareness states, a photorealistic VE was created. Resulting scenes displayed on a head-mounted display (HMD) with or without head tracking and desktop monitor were then compared to the real-world task situation they represented, investigating spatial memory after exposure. Participants described how they completed their spatial recollections by selecting one of four choices of awareness states after retrieval in an initial test and a retention test a week after exposure to the environment. These reflected the level of visual mental imagery involved during retrieval, the familiarity of the recollection and also included guesses, even if informed. Experimental results revealed variations in the distribution of participants awareness states across conditions while, in certain cases, task performance failed to reveal any. Experimental conditions that incorporated head tracking were not associated with visually induced recollections. Generally, simulation of task performance does not necessarily lead to simulation of the awareness states involved when completing a memory task. The general premise of this research focuses on how tasks are achieved, rather than only on what is achieved. The extent to which judgments of human memory recall, memory awareness states, and presence in the physical and VE are similar provides a fidelity metric of the simulation in question.",

            "abstract" : "Responses of 150 IEEE members to a telephone survey sponsored by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a Japanese counterpart to The Wall Street Journal, are reported. The interviews were conducted by the Gallup Organization Incorporated. The respondents-50 each from government, industrial, and academic facilities-answered more than two dozen questions, some of which were suggested by the IEEE, regarding the relative position of the US and Japan. The survey showed, among other findings, that US engineers believe the US holds a technological edge over Japan in many areas. The majority also believe that the US lead will continue into the next century and that the Japanese should not be credited with being technological innovators since they have been using basic technology developed in other countries.",

In the first year, students are made aware of the importance of becoming good writers and speakers and how this can impact on their careers. Exercises in proofreading are conducted by a consultant in introductory level classes. In the second year, typical exercises include classroom note taking and short verbal presentations based on the notes. Laboratory journals and more formal laboratory reports are also introduced. Additional laboratory report writing and a formal research paper are emphasized in the third year. An exercise in teamwork is presented in a third year course to help students in the many collaborative projects they encounter in upper level engineering projects. All fourth year students take a full year capstone senior design course which includes many written submissions and oral presentations.",

The author analyzes the differing discourse communities of academic writing and technical communication which may limit the transfer of skills from one arena to the next. The discussion considers the ways process, collaborative learning, writing across the curriculum, and language theories can form the foundation for constructive communication among disciplines. As the focus of academic writing moves from an emphasis on the individual to social context and wider audiences, it bridges the gap between disciplines and can ease the movement from the classroom to real-world settings.",

To become accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) requires that at least 24 credits of design content be included in the four-year undergraduate engineering curriculum. Senior design is the principal course in which students apply their knowledge in several disciplines to one project assignment and is a significant step towards meeting ABET requirements. Engineering experience acquired in the senior design course is a valuable aid to students as they learn how to apply theory to an actual design project. The senior design course develops project management and oral and written communication skills and enables students to learn scheduling, team coordination and cooperation, parts ordering, and cost/performance tradeoffs. Ten senior design projects that have won IEEE and SME student paper contests are presented herein as a guide in the difficult selection of suitable design topics. The unique nature of the senior design course requires certain departures from usual engineering course organization if students are to derive the maximum benefit. Senior design is nearly equivalent to an industrial internship and may be more valuable as the first step a student takes in making the transition to working engineer.",

Two types of bus-based homogeneous and heterogeneous multi-core systems are modeled and simulated by a cycle-accurate simulation platform. Unlike the conventional time-division multiplexing (TDM) bus-based multi-core system that shows degradation in performance as the number of processing cores increases, the proposed SSCDMA bus-based multi-core shows higher performance up to 23.1% for 4 cores. The maximum latency of a heterogeneous multi-core system with a mix of traffic loads has been reduced up to 78%. These results demonstrate that the performance of multi-core systems can be improved with less cost and network complexity by reducing the bus contention interferences and by supporting higher concurrency in memory accesses that brings shorter critical word access latency.",

In this paper, we present FT-Pro, an adaptive fault management approach that combines proactive migration with reactive checkpointing. It aims to enable parallel applications to avoid anticipated failures via preventive migration and, in the case of unforeseeable failures, to minimize their impact through selective checkpointing. An adaptation manager is designed to make runtime decisions in response to failure prediction. Extensive experiments, by means of stochastic modeling and case studies with real applications, indicate that FT-Pro outperforms periodic checkpointing, in terms of reducing application completion times and improving resource utilization, by up to 43 percent.",

The range of applications of computer-controlled devices is not yet known, but many companies are racing more and more new designs into production. Colleges and Universities across the nation are scrambling to develop mechatronics courses, research, and even degrees in order to meet the demands of these industrial innovations. One area in mechatronic systems that promises new growth and challenges for industry as well as diverse and interesting learning challenges for academia is in the area of computer controlled fluid power systems. Fluid power systems are used in a wide variety of applications, and operate with various levels of complexity that can offer challenges at many levels in the classroom and laboratory setting. We discuss the development of a mechatronics course at Iowa State University with a focus on the application of this technology to fluid systems.",

The fifth year is dedicated to a complete design and manufacturing of a computer controlled machine in industry. Teams of two students design the complete mechanical system with actuators, sensors and computer control units under the joint supervision of a faculty member and a qualified engineer designated by the sponsoring company.

It has its foundations based on a multi-disciplinary International Virtual Design Studio (MIVDS) course as a capstone design senior project, which is in progress since 1996. The motivation behind this trend is the strong preferences put by the industries towards engineers having a basic knowledge on mechatronic design techniques and design elements such as sensors, actuators and microprocessors. Engineering Faculty of the Middle East Technical University is planning to achieve this new profile of engineers by introducing the interdisciplinary mechatronics minor program. The working philosophy of this effort is that the mechatronics material will be integrated initially into the existing disciplinary programs of Mechanical, Electrical, Computer and Aeronautical Engineering Departments. Students who have successfully completed the program will be given a certificate of mechatronics in addition to their disciplinary degrees.",

We argue that user require ments from research, education, ergonomics and applications impose a certain functionality on the embedded operating system and programming language, and that a deadline-driven real-time operating system helps to fulfil these requirements. A case study of the operating system XO/2, its programming language Oberon-2 and the mobile robot Pygmalion is presented. XO/2 explicitly addresses issues like scalabilty, safety and abstraction, previously found to be relevant for many user scenarios.",

            "abstract" : "Radio frequency (RF) involves complexities in the circuit design. Non-linearity issues in active as well as passive circuit designs and issues such as parasitic couplings and radiation effects introduce challenges in the RF circuit designs. Besides these, engineers face challenges, such as reduction in design cycle, overall development cost, and the time to market. To address these challenges, RF designs require extensive analysis and simulations techniques, as well as special measurement techniques. Traditionally, at the system level, separate groups design ICs and packages. However, cost, time-to-market issues, and ever-growing package complexity in the nanometer design space demand close collaboration between design groups. System level integration with SiP requires design flows and methodologies that bridge the gap between IC design and package design. An RF SiP is a complete functional system or sub system that includes multiple ICs from different or same process technology, and embedded passives connected using a complex RF structure. This system or sub system can either be packaged as an IC and mounted or integrated into a PCB. This tutorial will first introduce the basic understanding and challenges in RF system designs. This will be followed by the discussion on the analysis, simulation and measurement techniques used for RF designs. Finally, the tutorial would talk about the RF SiP flow and the design methodology. An RF SiP design example will be used to discuss various aspects of SiP, interfaces between IC layout and SiP layout, embedded components, interconnects, constraints, SiP level routing, design rule checks and RF SiP level simulation. In the next generation nanometer designs, the RF SiP design flow and methodology will be critical to meet the overall design requirements",

Perceived advances in control systems research can easily be offset by suspect experimental evaluations resulting from narrow investigations into specific problems. Likewise, attention to implementation details is unquestionably a necessary component of any control design, often to the extent of actual experimentation. In this brief paper we provide philosophical views on issues related to the impact of experimental work on the field of control systems, and on the relative value of toy projects, laboratory scale testbeds, and full-scale experimental apparatus. In so doing we represent the university viewpoint, where experimentation serves a dual purpose: research and education.",

            "abstract" : "Storage technology is an essential part of computing. The most common device currently in use to store data is the direct access storage device (DASD) or disk drives as they are commonly known. Since their inception in 1956, DASDs have undergone a revolutionary change, and now several generations later store, retrieve, and archive massive quantities of data reliably at a rate (data rate) that renders real-time computing, graphical display, and other forms of data processing possible. The demand for data storage continues to increase very rapidly and therefore, the designers of disk drives continue to push the limits and find new frontiers in recording. At the same time, new methods of recording to increase the data densities and data rate are being pursued. Phase change optical recording and magneto-optical recording show promise for data storage for multimedia applications on one hand and inexpensive storage and retrieval devices such as magnetic tape drives are in wide use for common storage needs where data rate is of little significance. In designing of these devices, expertise in many disciplines such as electromagnetics, mechanics, tribology, heat and mass transfer, mechanical design and dynamics of mechanisms is required and the design process is very complicated. In this article, we will study how these disciplines come together and are linked together. Thus Mechatronics in the disk drives applications means study of interactive effects of disciplines listed above.",

The first case study was developed by Burford Furman, an academician with strong industrial experience. It is related to the design of atomic force microscopes (AFMs) for measuring the topography of surfaces at submicron precision. The case demonstrates the application of the principles of mechanics, e.g., beam theory, use of piezoelectric actuators, high precision motion control, and manufacturing methods which can produce structures that are responsive to minute disturbances yet have sufficiently high resonant frequencies. This case is an example where materials engineering plays a significant role in the design of a mechatronic product. The second case was written by two senior engineers, D. Pinkernell and S. Elgee, from the Hewlett-Packard Company. The ingenuity of integrating mechanical components (motors, gears, belts, shafts, etc.), optoelectronics sensors, microprocessors, power ICs, and computer software to produce this popular mechatronic product is demonstrated.",

A conceptual approach to cooperative learning has been developed at the University of Minnesota which is characterized by five basic elements: positive interdependence, face-to-face promotive interaction, individual accountability, collaborative skills, and group processing. Work has focussed on applying the research and development of each of the strategies to the college classroom. Cognitive research on how students learn, research on the importance of social support, research on the importance of collaborative skills, and the research on the importance of active involvement to the cooperative learning strategies mentioned above are being integrated and related. It is concluded that implementing cooperative learning in the college classroom would assist in getting students meaningfully involved in learning and focussing attention on active learning to help prepare self-directed, autonomous learners.",

An organization has been determined, which for the authors, balances team experience, individual assessment, design complexity, realism, writing content, and faculty workload. The current course structure is based on the integration of a capstone program with the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC) sponsored by the Association For Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI). The competition rules require that the students design and build an autonomous land vehicle which can navigate while sensing lane lines, avoiding obstacles, and traveling over ramps and sand traps. There are two main competition events: the vehicle performance competition where the autonomous robotic vehicles compete to finish the course in the shortest time or by traveling the farthest in the allotted time, and the vehicle design competition that evaluates the documentation, design process, and presentation of each team. The authors have found that this type of competition matches both the spirit and the practical needs of their capstone design course.",

            "abstract" : "The use of a dielectric elastomer (DE) tubular actuator for adaptive vibration isolation, where an electromechanical model of the actuator is utilised as part of the estimation scheme is examined. Active vibration isolation, with time varying loads, is considered. Adaptive estimation of a black-box cancellation path model is normally required to ensure convergence of the filtered-x least mean squares (LMS) estimated feedforward controller. Here the feasibility of using a physical-based electromechanical model of the combined DE actuator and its `sensitive load as the cancellation path model is investigated. The current implementation involves auto-tuning a FIR filter representation of the physical-based cancellation path model whenever a loading change in the system is detected. When the FIR filter representation has been updated the adaptive feedforward control automatically turns back on. Load sensing is required to supply a value of the time-varying load to the model.",

They consider such a humanoid robot through the realistic tasks/jobs it will most probably do. It is postulated that this humanoid robot be considered as a personal helper (a home robot or personal robot). Given the present level of technology, the question is posed: are we ready to move towards personal robotics, and what might be the first step? A possible answer to this question is given through a discussion of the human-like characteristics a personal robot must have; namely, human-like motion, human-like intelligence, and human-like communication.",

            "abstract" : "We consider the problem of map learning while maintaining ground-truth pose estimates. Map learning is important in tasks that require a model of the environment or some of its features. As a robot collects data, uncertainty about its position accumulates and corrupts its knowledge of the positions from which observations are taken. We address this problem by employing cooperative localization; that is, deploying a second robot to observe the other as it explores, thereby establishing a virtual tether, and enabling an accurate estimate of the robots position while it constructs the map. The paper presents our approach to this problem in the context of learning a set of visual landmarks useful for pose estimation. In addition to developing a formalism and concept, we validate our results experimentally and present quantitative results demonstrating the performance of the method.",

The combination of already well-known Lagrange and finite-element methods seems to be a great advantage in this modeling procedure. Lightwave flexible links, although known to save a large amount of operational energy, are not popular in the industry because of difficulty in their modeling and control. Following the methodology suggested, modeling is reduced to a mechanical procedure capable of efficient computer implementation. A simple controller is suggested. The controller is designed using the MATLAB simulation package, and the results are compared graphically. The lessons learned form the project are reported.",

Most systems used in educational settings were not designed specifically for such use. In many cases, most of a students laboratory time is spent learning the particular system in use, rather than the complexities of the assigned algorithm. The IBM PC based system described here, which consists of an adapter card for the PC, a standard black-and-white video camera and monitor, and a collection of image processing algorithms, eliminates this problem. The major advantages of the system described are its low cost and extremely simple programming interface. Both the hardware design of the adapter card and the software interface are described.",

Based on a nonlinear mathematical model of a series-connected DC motor, it is shown that the combination of a nonlinear transformation and state feedback (feedback linearization) reduces the nonlinear control design to a linear control design. To demonstrate its effectiveness, an experimental study of this controller is presented. These experimental results are also compared with a simulation of the closed-loop system. Finally, it is shown that a nonlinear observer (with linear error dynamics) for speed and load torque can be constructed based only on measurements of the motor current. Experimental results of this speed and load-torque estimator are also presented.",

            "title" : "Gain adaptation of networked DC motor controllers based on QoS variations",
            "abstract" : "Connecting a complex control system with various sensors, actuators, and controllers as a networked control system by a shared data network can effectively reduce complicated wiring connections. This system is also easy to install and maintain. The trend is to use networked control systems for time-sensitive applications, such as remote DC motor actuation control. The performance of a networked control system can be improved if the network can guarantee quality-of-service (QoS). Due to time-varying network traffic demands and disturbances, QoS requirements provided by a network may change. In this case, a network has to reallocate its resources and may not be able to provide QoS requirements to a networked control application as needed. Therefore, the application may have to gracefully degrade its performance and perform the task as best as possible with the provided network QoS. This paper proposes a novel approach for networked DC motor control systems using controller gain adaptation to compensate for the changes in QoS requirements. Numerical and experimental simulations, and prototyping, are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed adaptation scheme to handle network QoS variation in a control loop. The effective results show the promising future of the use of gain adaptation in networked control applications.",

            "abstract" : "One of the most recent topics in variable-structure systems theory is represented by the second-order sliding-mode control (2-SMC) methodology. This approach guarantees the same robustness and dynamic performance of traditional first-order SMC algorithms, and, at the same time, attenuates the chattering phenomenon, which is the main drawback in the actual implementation of this technique. In the present paper, a recently-proposed 2-SMC algorithm is used to synthesize a robust dc-drive control system which does not require current feedback and demands only rough information about the actual motor parameters. Stability and performance are analyzed, and an experimental comparison with a proportional-integral-based control scheme is reported.",

Such assessment allows individual students to track their learning; instructors are empowered to administer targeted remedial instruction to individuals and to discern larger patterns of challenges faced by the class. The power of computer medium is harnessed in providing, for example, discovery-learning that integrates questions with simulations, demonstrations of procedures, and opportunities for learners to practice skills while receiving hints and feedback",

            "abstract" : "Two laboratory-scale experiments have been developed that can be executed safely over the Internet. They provide practical experience for students of process control. Remote access is within a client-server paradigm. Servers connected to the processes through the usual data acquisition hardware address issues regarding safety, security, data validation, and session management. A unique feature of the lab is the ability for the student to design, test, and verify control strategies in real time over the Internet. Necessary interlocks and cutoffs ensure safe remote operation of the units. Studies have shown that network speeds are not a significant concern for these systems due to slow process dynamics. The availability of Internet-mediated laboratory modules on an anytime/anywhere basis will enable a larger fraction of the class to get valuable laboratory experience. These experiments have also been used in an Internet-wired classroom for interactive demonstrations during lecture.",

The control of an inverted pendulum is used to demonstrate the use of such an environment. The main attributes of this Web-based lab are: 1) the on-line interactivity with the didactic setup, 2) the possibility of defining different experiments by using parameter files, and 3) the open architecture of the environment which allows easy development of new experiments with other didactic setups. The structure of this Web-based lab not only provides students with quantitative information feedback but also allows visual supervision. Now, a remote-controlled camera plays an important role within a remote experimentation environment with mobile parts. Students can handle the camera on-line, just as they can control the didactic setup over the Internet.",

            "abstract" : "Engineering education by its nature is a costly program in university environments. Perhaps the most costly component is the laboratory facility, usually consisting of specialized equipment. Effective instruction of some topics in power engineering education requires experience with actual equipment, rather than small-scale replicas or simulation. In this paper, a new laboratory approach is described, as implemented in a virtual, Internet-based, experimentation platform. This virtual laboratory (VLab) utilizes real equipment distributed among multiple universities from which remotely located students can perform experiments. The software solution is a multiuser, client-server architecture developed in the LabVIEW environment. Implementation details including video, chat, archiving, and the hardware and software platforms are presented in the paper. An example presented herein is the study of current and voltage waveforms while controlling relays and low-voltage contactors. The applications have been tested with student teams enrolled in the electrical engineering department of Politehnica University of Bucharest and the power engineering program at Arizona State University.",

Testing theories through practice is an important approach to scientific teaching, and appropriate solutions have not yet been found to support this activity in Web-based education. The on-line laboratory addresses this issue. It allows the execution via Web of real experiments and manages concurrency among users who remotely drive instruments and carry out experiments. The experimental setup can be distributed in different real laboratories, spread on a wide-area network, and controlled by local computers. Users can practice through the network and transparently to the actual locations of the devices under test in a multiuser concurrent way.

            "abstract" : "Remote laboratories are laboratories where the hardware devices are accessible through the Internet 24 h a day for running experiments on physical processes. These laboratories are commonly used as complementary tools in engineering education, allowing students to integrate theoretical notions with practical experiments without the necessity of being physically present inside a laboratory. The increased availability of experiments in a remote laboratory is certainly an advantage for students, but it implies an increase of the probability of hardware and software failures. Thus, maintaining physical processes in a remote laboratory may become a heavy task for laboratory administrators. Remote laboratory inefficiency due to hardware and software maintenance can be certainly reduced if the time that is required for software reinstallation and/or upgrade is kept as short as possible. In this paper, a technique based on the use of a bootable (live) device on the server side of a remote laboratory is reported. This solution, which, in principle, can be used in almost any remote laboratory, allows an administrator to greatly reduce the time that is needed to fix a hardware/software failure, as well as to add a new process to the laboratory in a faster way. Moreover, the use of such a tool will also increase the reliability of the entire laboratory. The application of the proposed method to the ldquoAutomatic Control Telelab,rdquo which is a remote laboratory that was developed at the University of Siena, is also described in detail.",

Similar problems are found when work is of a complex and safety-critical nature (e.g., nuclear environments, explosive placement, surgery). This paper describes a method of education and training involving offline usage of virtual environments for task planning. When tasks are developed to the satisfaction of the trainee, they are exported to remote physical hardware, via the Internet, for real-world execution. Development of the system and the training experiments is discussed, along with some of the issues raised for telerobotics and solutions to the problem of detecting collisions in the virtual world. The approach has been shown to be viable and increases the education and training possibilities for key workers while maintaining a low cost of ownership. The downtime of mission-critical equipment is minimized while the gaining of valuable experience is maximized.",

            "abstract" : "In this paper, we present the user interface and the system architecture of an Internet-based telelaboratory, which allows researchers and students to remotely control and program two educational online robots. In fact, the challenge has been to demonstrate that remote programming combined with an advanced multimedia user interface for remote control is very suitable, flexible, and profitable for the design of a telelaboratory. The user interface has been designed by using techniques based on augmented reality and nonimmersive virtual reality, which enhance the way operators get/put information from/to the robotic scenario. Moreover, the user interface provides the possibility of letting the operator manipulate the remote environment by using multiple ways of interaction (i.e., from the simplification of the natural language to low-level remote programming). In fact, the paper focuses on the lowest level of interaction between the operator and the robot, which is remote programming. As explained in the paper, the system architecture permits any external program (i.e., remote experiment, speech-recognition module, etc.) to have access to almost every feature of the telelaboratory (e.g., cameras, object recognition, robot control, etc.). The system validation was performed by letting 40 Ph.D. students within the European Robotics Research Network Summer School on Internet and Online Robots for Telemanipulation workshop (Benica/spl grave/ssim, Spain, 2003) program several telemanipulation experiments with the telelaboratory. Some of these experiments are shown and explained in detail. Finally, the paper focuses on the analysis of the network performance for the proposed architecture (i.e., time delay). In fact, several configurations are tested through various networking protocols (i.e., Remote Method Invocation, Transmission Control Protocol/IP, User Datagram Protocol/IP). Results show the real possibilities offered by these remote-programming techniques, in order to design experiments intended to be performed from both home and the campus.",

A service-oriented architecture was devised for online experiment systems, enabled by Web service protocols, and a methodology for wrapping the operations of the instruments into Web services. Although these methods arent suitable for time-critical missions or applications that need real-time control, they do work for controlling standard commercial instruments over low-speed or unreliable communication networks. Using this framework, an online experiment system for students can be created that incorporates a great variety of instruments and that users can access without installing special software",

            "abstract" : "The task of planning trajectories for a mobile robot has received considerable attention in the research literature. Most of the work assumes the robot has a complete and accurate model of its environment before it begins to move; less attention has been paid to the problem of partially known environments. This situation occurs for an exploratory robot or one that must move to a goal location without the benefit of a floorplan or terrain map. Existing approaches plan an initial path based on known information and then modify the plan locally or replan the entire path as the robot discovers obstacles with its sensors, sacrificing optimality or computational efficiency respectively. This paper introduces a new algorithm, D*, capable of planning paths in unknown, partially known, and changing environments in an efficient, optimal, and complete manner.",

In this paper, we discuss our choice of robot, describe the projects we assigned and list the problems our students encountered carrying out those projects. We surveyed our class regarding the use of robots in this course at the end of the semester. We discuss the results of this survey, which we believe, make a strong case for using robots in the AI course.",

This method, named the vector field histogram (VFH), permits the detection of unknown obstacles and avoids collisions while simultaneously steering the mobile robot toward the target. The VFH method uses a two-dimensional Cartesian histogram grid as a world model. This world model is updated continuously with range data sampled by onboard range sensors. The VFH method subsequently uses a two-stage data-reduction process to compute the desired control commands for the vehicle. Experimental results from a mobile robot traversing densely cluttered obstacle courses in smooth and continuous motion and at an average speed of 0.6-0.7 m/s are shown. A comparison of the VFN method to earlier methods is given.",

            "abstract" : "This paper describes a practical method for reducing odometry errors caused by kinematic imperfections of a mobile robot. These errors, here referred to as systematic errors, stay almost constant over a prolonged period of time. Performing an occasional calibration as described here will increase the robots odometric accuracy and reduce operation cost because an accurate mobile robot requires fewer absolute positioning updates. Many manufacturers or end-users calibrate their robots-usually in a time-consuming and non-systematic trial and error approach. By contrast the authors method is systematic, provides near-optimal results, and can be performed easily and without complicated equipment. Experimental results are presented that show a consistent improvement of at least one order of magnitude in odometric accuracy (with respect to systematic errors) for a mobile robot calibrated with the procedure described in this paper.",

Layers are made up of asynchronous modules that communicate over low-bandwidth channels. Each module is an instance of a fairly simple computational machine. Higher-level layers can subsume the roles of lower levels by suppressing their outputs. However, lower levels continue to function as higher levels are added. The result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system has been used to control a mobile robot wandering around unconstrained laboratory areas and computer machine rooms. Eventually it is intended to control a robot that wanders the office areas of our laboratory, building maps of its surroundings using an onboard arm to perform simple tasks.",

To stimulate the students interests of AI research and introduce the RoboCup games to more students, we transplant the RoboCup to an educational platform for students to study and research. This paper shows the structure and design of the whole platform, the specific implementation of basic modules on the educational platform. The platform is divided into three parts: low-level module, libraries, and program scheme. Students should work in the programming scheme part, build the basic skill and top-level strategy layer. This paper describes the main theory of the basic skills such as dribble, kick, and shoot, including the distributed planning in realizing these skills. The top-level strategy part analyzes the realization of several basic strategies and machine learnings impact on the game. We also provide the method and framework for implementing the basic skills and top-level strategy, called the qsinghuAeolus program. Finally, we show the educational value of the platform in RoboCup simulation games.",

This is in contrast to the other branch of rescue, wilderness rescue, that concerns people lost in open spaces. Recent advances in robotics platforms and intelligent software, combined with the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing in the United earthquake in Japan, followed by earthquakes in Taiwan and Turkey, have led to a growing international USAR robotics community.",

In this course, the students design small mobile robots to perform a task specified at the beginning of the quarter. The designs are evaluated by how well they complete the specified task. The mobile robot systems are developed through a sequence of subsystem design projects. These subsystems are developed and demonstrated in the laboratory component of the course. The lectures focus on providing the information required to design the system, on the more practical aspects of engineering practice, and on showing how more theoretical concepts learned in other courses can be applied in practice. This course has been offered twice and we deduce from the students designs and evaluations that it has been successful.",

This makes the capstone course very difficult for students and compromises its pedagogical aims. A good design experience offers opportunities for learning to identify key operational concepts, to identify and remedy procedural and factual knowledge deficits, and to exercise judgment. The design problem should be open-ended, moderately difficult, and common to all groups. We use a design contest as a vehicle for teaching design in the junior-year analog electronics course, in lieu of conventional laboratories. Students design and build analog circuitry to autonomously control a small robotic vehicle. The contest culminates in a competitive tournament. Students questionnaire responses indicate that the contest is a useful learning tool, increasing interest in electrical engineering and well worth the time spent. They indicate that contests are preferable to conventional labs for learning and understanding course material, for motivating them, and for providing an engineering experience.",

Ideally, however, a professional should be at least at Perry Position 6. At this level of development, the individual uses evidence, logic, and investigated standards to make decisions in an ambiguous real-world situation. Also, the individual understands the need for individual commitment in the decision process. Thus a goal of collegiate education should be to help students develop from about Position 2 to Position 6. The engineering and science students at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) have been tested to determine what development actually does occur in the four years of the undergraduate experience. The data obtained should help drive discussion and redesign of curricula if the Position 6 developmental goal is not being achieved. The data show that a large fraction of seniors have not even reached Position 5, and some are still below 4.0.",

The Intel 8088 microprocessor was chosen to make the mouse compatible with the PC systems which are universally available. Two stepping motors and eight optical sensors are used to complete the system. Software is written in C and Assembly language with over 2000 lines. Seven micromice have been built since 1990 and several of these mice have won several awards in the IEEE Region Six Southern California competition. Integration of the project with the conventional curriculum has been very successful in motivating students and keeping their interest high.

An embedded computing system uses microprocessors to implement parts of the functionality of non-general-purpose computers. Early microprocessor-based design courses, based on simple microprocessors, emphasized input and output (I/O). Modern high-performance embedded processors are capable of a great deal of computation in addition to I/O tasks. Taking advantage of this capability requires a knowledge of fundamental concepts in the analysis and design of concurrent computing systems. We believe that next-generation courses in embedded computing should move away from the discussion of components and toward the discussion of analysis and design of systems.",

            "abstract" : "This paper describes a cooperative experiential learning activity to develop embedded systems design skills. Student teams design, build, and troubleshoot a microcontroller-based project composed of common embedded systems peripherals, including input/output and electromechanical devices, industry standard communication networks, and complex digital integrated circuits. The design experience is progressive, requiring each successive subsystem to be incorporated without disturbing previously completed subsystems. Furthermore, the design experience is based on a problem-based learning approach that motivates student learning and develops skills required by the student in a future professional capacity. These skills include designing to specification, use of third-party intellectual property, teamwork, communication, and lifelong learning skills. The design experience was offered to a cohort in conjunction with lectures using active learning techniques. Course evaluations were obtained from students and external reviewers, and the results show that the course was well received and achieved its educational objectives.",

Recent years show efforts to integrate technology into all levels of the school curriculum. The work presented here introduces one possible approach to familiarize 5/sup th/ to 6/sup th/ grade pupils with high level technology using a mobile robot as the principal tool in the curriculum. Children construct an open ended, autonomous robot while working in teams (6 per team). Each team is divided into sub-groups that represent the various skills needed for the construction and operation of the robot. They use a flow-chart software as their programming frame. At first, the teams are given simple missions, and as they progress, they are challenged with open-ended, more complex assignments. Each weekly session lasts about three hours of which a third is devoted to knowledge expansion and the rest for testing and construction. During the test phase, pupils perform experiments for deducing device properties (sensor, motor, control method, etc.). They add the device of their choice to their mobile robot system. As a typical open-ended problem, the team explores possible solutions to each problem. Then they are expected to define their solutions and implement Them. At the end of the year there is a contest between robots built by the various teams, to accomplish a predefined task.",

If the programming domain consists of physical objects with observable behaviour, such as a robot and its environment, then incorporating the obvious visual representations of these objects directly into the programming process may further increase the programmers effectiveness and accuracy. We propose a robot programming system consisting of two parts; a definition module with which to describe the structure, function and visual representation of a specific robot, and a programming module that uses this description to enable programming by direct manipulation. We describe the visual editors that constitute the first of these modules, discuss the underlying structure generated by it, and briefly show how this structure can be used in the second module.",

These conditions present a number of performance limitations. Accordingly, we are developing an inverse of this type of mobile robot that is the height, width, and weight of a person, having a high center of gravity, that balances dynamically on a single spherical wheel. Unlike balancing 2-wheel platforms which must turn before driving in some direction, the single-wheel robot can move directly in any direction. We present the overall design, actuator mechanism based on an inverse mouse-ball drive, control system, and initial results including dynamic balancing, station keeping, and point-to-point motion",

            "abstract" : "Cooperative transportation of an object by two or more mobile robots requires each robot to exert an appropriate force to support and move the object, to move along the object, and to maintain its attitude. A mechanically unstable robot, such as a wheeled inverted pendulum, needs to control the force and follow the object as standing stably against the force in an integrated manner. We call this a cooperative behavior. To realize this behavior of a wheeled inverted pendulum, we built control systems to estimate the external force and maintain standing and to exert a specified force. We applied them to a wheeled inverted pendulum. Experiments were conducted of cooperative transportation between a human and the robot. In the future, we aim to realize cooperative transportation by two wheeled inverted pendulums using the control systems.",

Inertial navigation system error dynamic is augmented by inertial sensor bias and drifts to improve the integration performance. To estimate the augmented error model states GPS position is used.

While aiding INS with GPS in different motion scenarios of land vehicles, it is observed that down gyro drift estimation is very weak. When land vehicle is stationary, a zero turning update algorithm (ZTUPT) is proposed to improve observability of the down gyro drift. Down gyro drift estimation is simulated by using ZTUPT algorithm. It is seen that while calibrating down gyro drift, ZTUPT works better than position update.",

Strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) error model is augmented by inertial sensor bias and drift and GPS clock bias and drift to improve the integration performance. To estimate the augmented state error, instead of GPS position, GPS pseudoranges and pseudorange rates are used. In tightly-coupled integration GPS and INS under different motion conditions, it is observed that the vertical gyro drift estimation is very weak in all cases of stationary, linear motion, and three-axis sway motion via Kalman filter covariance analysis. In order to solve the vertical gyroscope drift estimation problem, zero update velocity (ZUPT) algorithm is proposed to improve the observability of vertical gyro drift. Computer simulation is carried out by this algorithm to validate the feasibility of the concept. The simulation results demonstrate that vertical gyro drift can be better estimated for the sake of compensation afterward.",

The authors also proposed a basic control method of whole body cooperative dynamic biped walking that uses trunk or trunk-waist cooperative motion to compensate for three-axis (pitch, roll and yaw-axis) moment generated not only by the motion of the lower-limbs planned arbitrarily but by the time trajectory of the hands planned arbitrarily.

            "abstract" : "MEL HORSE has been developed for studying quadruped robot and biped robot. The control of zero moment point (ZMP) is indispensable in order for a legged type robot to walk dynamically. By the conventional method, optimization calculation is required in order to calculate the true ZMP, and this is time consuming. Moreover, if it depends on the o(R)-line calculation, then the situation which is not expected when carrying out real-time control of the robot cannot be dealt with. This paper describes the ZMP control using the receding horizon control which is a technique of real-time optimization to cope with the problem mentioned. According to this technique, it is possible to generate an ZMP reference trajectory autonomously in real time.",

This paper proposes a method to reduce the motion range of the trunk by generating a desired trajectory of the zero-moment point (ZMP). The trajectory is determined by a fuzzy logic based upon the leg trajectories that are arbitrary selected. The resulting ZMP trajectory is similar to humans one and the ZMP continuously moves forward. The proposed scheme is simulated on a 7-degree-of-freedom biped robot. Its results indicate that the proposed ZMP trajectory increases the stability of the locomotion and thus resulting in reduction of motion range of the trunk.",

In this paper, to realize dynamic stable walking, a novel control strategy is formulated, which is based on both the centre of gravity (COG) and the zero moment point (ZMP) of the biped supporting leg control. This control algorithm involves the following two stages: 1) trajectory generation of the ZMP for the realization of the arbitrary COG trajectory; and 2) the ZMP controller which directly control the ZMP of the supporting foot. The ZMP trajectory is generated according to the tracking error of the COG and based on the fuzzy logic. This algorithm makes it possible to realize the arbitrary COG trajectory by the position command of the ZMP which satisfies the dynamic walking stability with no consideration of nonlinear relationship between the ZMP and COG. The ZMP of the supporting foot is controlled directly by the proposed ZMP controller even if unknown external force imposes on the robot. The experimental results of a 6-DOF biped walking robot in sagittal plane are presented.",

In order to walk stably in various environments such as rough terrain, up and down slopes, or regions containing obstacles, it is desirable to adapt to such ground conditions with a suitable foot motion, and maintain the stability of the robot by a smooth hip motion. We propose a method to plan a walking pattern consisting of a foot trajectory and a hip trajectory. First, we formulate the constraints of a foot trajectory, and generate the foot trajectory by 3rd order spline interpolation. By setting the values of constraint parameters, it is easy to produce different types of foot motion. Then, we formulate a hip trajectory using a 3rd order periodic spline function, and derive the hip trajectory with high stability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by simulation examples.",

A control method which divides the walking into motions in the sagittal plane and in the lateral plane has been adopted. For motion in the sagittal plane, the angular momentum is placed close to a smooth reference function given in advance by controlling the ankle torque of the supporting leg. For motion in the lateral plane, the motion control is treated as a regulator problem with two equilibrium states. The effectiveness of the proposed control method has been examined by experiments with the BLR-G2 walking robot. The BLR-G2 achieved 3-D walking at a speed of 0.35 m/s.",

            "abstract" : "The transformation from high level task specification to low level motion control is a fundamental issue in sensorimotor control in animals and robots. This paper describes a control scheme called virtual model control that addresses this issue. Virtual model control is a motion control language that uses simulations of imagined mechanical components to create forces, which are applied through real joint torques, thereby creating the illusion that the virtual components are connected to the robot. Due to the intuitive nature of this technique, designing a virtual model controller requires the same skills as designing the mechanism itself. A high level control system can be cascaded with the low level virtual model controller to modulate the parameters of the virtual mechanisms. Discrete commands from the high level controller would then result in fluid motion. Virtual model control has been applied to a physical bipedal walking robot. A simple algorithm utilizing a simple set of virtual components has successfully compelled the robot to walk continuously over level terrain.",

By means of sensing devices, namely position sensors on the joints and force sensors underneath the heel and toe, the robot is able to detect the transition of the supporting terrain from a flat floor to a sloping surface. An algorithm is developed for the biped robot control system to evaluate the inclination of the supporting foot and the unknown gradient, and a compliant motion scheme is then used to enable the robot to transfer from level walking to climbing the slope. While the robot walks on the slope, the gait synthesis is a simple modification to the one used for level walking. Experiments with the SD-2 biped robot show that the overall scheme, while simple to implement, is powerful and reliable enough to permit walking from level to slope or vice versa. Finally, it is argued that the proposed mechanism can be extended to quasi-dynamic and dynamic gaits.",

A control signal may cause data transfer between functional units, test the status of a functional unit, or cause a functional unit to perform a specific internal function. A single data bus connects each of the functional units and the control processor such that the flow and manipulation of data are controlled by a microprogram.

The tools are based on objects which admit direct graphical manipulation. During manipulations, objects are updated instantaneously, so that relations between objects are maintained all the time. The tools are natural complements to traditional education, and allow students to quickly gain insight and motivation. A high degree of interactivity has been found to be a key issue in the design. Together with a high bandwidth in the man-machine interaction, this enhances learning significantly. Another nice feature is the possibility to hide minor issues and focus on the essentials. It is not easy to describe the power of these tools adequately in text. The best way to appreciate them is simply to use them. We believe that there is a strong pedagogical potential for the type of tools that we have described. We are also of the opinion that we are only at the very beginning in the development of learning tools of this type. The addition of sound and animation are interesting avenues that should be pursued.",

Accompanied by a Web page, the material is partly tutorial, enabling readers to step in at their current levels and move forward in their Web usage. For those readers who have not yet made use of the Web in their courses, we will demonstrate models of Web sites for consideration to suggest what can be done, and offer introductory steps for implementation. Experienced Web users and developers may use some of the more sophisticated models, identify what it means to manage a course with a Web site, improve their own design, and hear some tips on the hurdles to avoid. Specific applications to the control field are discussed, including software demonstrations and virtual and remote labs. In the end, it is hoped that readers will find information to move them a step forward from their current level.",

In addition, training the operators of these complex robotic systems is time-consuming and costly. In this paper a virtual reality based robotic control system is presented. The virtual reality system provides a means by which operators can operate, and be trained to operate, complex robotic systems in an intuitive, cost-effective way. Operator interaction with the robotic system is at a high, task-oriented, level. Continuous state monitoring prevents illegal robot actions and provides interactive feedback to the operator and real-time training for novice users.",

            "abstract" : "The establishment of a unique infrastructure for distributed robotics and remote operations research within an educational environment is reported. The distributed laboratory consists of sites at four universities and NASAs Johnson Space Center. The distributed laboratory configuration provides the opportunity to quantitatively study the effects of various system components and technologies on overall telerobotic task performance. The ability to execute representative inspection and manipulation tasks with multiple control, robot, and performance/workload monitoring sites simultaneously connected has been demonstrated. Operations are carried out on a routine basis. During the process, needs for hardware and software standards development have been identified. The current implementation provides a basis for linking government, industrial, and university facilities to realize a truly collaborative research and development environment, enabling graduate students to experience educational opportunities that would otherwise not be possible.",

In the design, telemonitoring force feedback is introduced as a new form of kinesthetic coupling; dynamic characteristics of the master and slave arms are actively modified based on generalized impedance control according to local design criteria; the human dynamics involved in generating a control command based on visual and force stimuli are incorporated into the controller design; and to balance the robustness/performance trade-off, system performance is optimized subject to a known maximum time delay. Simulation results suggest that the system is superior to conventional systems in terms of performance and robustness under short time delays and human control errors. Experimental evidence is presented to supports the advantages of the proposed telemonitoring force feedback. An experimental method for further validating the human dynamic model is described.",

We do so by describing research and applications on the boundary between measurement, instrumentation, and virtual environments, and elucidate trends with some examples. We focus on three issues that are relevant to our view. The first issue deals with some of the essentials of instrument computer coupling. This part has a review-like character, and shows how the traditional hardware instrument was transformed into a network-accessible virtual instrument. The second issue deals with the changes in the programming paradigm and user interface of the virtual instrument. Here, we discuss how the notions of object and the advances of computer graphics transformed the programming model and the interaction of the user with it and its associated data. The third part deals with new developments, which we label virtual environments. It also deals with (sensor) data fusion in abstract environments. We show how this work can be seen as a logical fusion of the previous two developments.",

Nowadays, such systems can be accessed through Web-enabled mobile devices, such as PDAs and cellular phones, which allow their users to perform simple tasks, such as contacting colleagues or reading messages. However, these devices present some constraints related to their intrinsic characteristics (reduced display size, limited memory capacity). These constraints make more acute the need for information filtering. We present a framework for awareness support which is able to adapt the awareness information to the users context, in order to reduce the risk of information overload. This framework, called BW-M, selects among the available awareness information that which matches the users, represented through pre-defined profiles, according to her/his current context.",

There are many important lessons to take away from this long-term, large-scale experiment with a living, ubiquitous computing environment.

The assumption that most people interact with these multimedia systems in similar ways can easily be made, but are these assumptions valid? What factors determine whether students will embrace computer-based multimedia-augmented learning? One factor may be a students personality type. This paper explores the reasons why some students may enjoy learning using computer-based educational delivery systems while others may have absolutely no enthusiasm for this type of learning, and how that enthusiasm may relate to the students personality types. The paper first explains the Digital VideoJockey-Version 2 (DVJ2) educational multimedia system in place at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, and then discusses the learning needs and expectations of different personality type characteristics. An analysis of students personality types and their DVJ2 system usage follows, and a discussion on possible ways to improve the DVJ2 system in light of this analysis concludes the paper.",

The ability to grade symbolic answers can be used synchronously (on-line quizzes or exams under monitored conditions) or asynchronously (e.g., homework, tutorials, or readiness tests) for a broad range of quantitative courses and levels. A database keeps extensive, detailed records of student performance. This paper describes a system for symbolic grading via a Web browser. After giving the background and a brief overview of the system, it presents two simple computer-gradable problems and the steps used to grade an illustrative problem.

The model draws from instructional design, distance learning and learning styles and is presented as a checklist to remind faculty of the events that are necessary for a successful learning experience. The paper then shows how technology can help this process by demonstrating one approach to web-based learning that will become the Rensselaer interactive distance learning model of the future. The Rensselaer 80/20 Model incorporates asynchronous and synchronous events in some proportion. 80/20 implies 80% asynchronous and 20% synchronous activities, although the actual numbers depend on the material, the learner and the instructor. The 80/20 Model uses existing course tools, such as WebCT, and provides guidance for designing asynchronous, multi-mediated web pages for learning. It also extends WebCT by adding an additional browser window (called the Guide on the Side window) that functions as a humanized electronic study guide. This results in an effective and efficient asynchronous learning experience nicely suited for professional education. However, one must also provide an appropriate infrastructure for both faculty and students to carry this out.",

However, most of this use was in the final two weeks of the semester, when students used surface learning strategies prior to exams. This approach was encouraged by the nature of the unit.",

As a result, they decided to offer the fall 1996 Introduction to Psychology course on the World Wide Web. There were several issues to think about. First, the authors saw the potential for a huge impact, since 80 to 85 percent of North Dakota State University students enrol in Psych110, most within their first two years. Second, they decided to design the course so that it could be offered for off-campus distance learning as well as on-campus resident instruction. Third, they decided to minimize overhead for students by using only a Web browser, e-mail, a textbook, and the textbook publishers demonstration/simulation software. Fourth, they chose to base decisions about course components on published literature covering cognition and teaching. Finally, they built in mid term and final student course evaluation components and a field experiment comparing student attitudes and learning outcome for online versus lecture classes.",

As a key element in e-learning, the provision of e-courses is essential to the learning effectiveness. This paper reports a pilot study on the pedagogy-driven approach to e-course development, where some critical success factors are identified. First, the appropriate use of information and communication technologies on content design is of utmost importance in order for an e-course to be useful to learners. Second, e-courses should be developed in order to meet the teaching and learning needs, whilst over-emphasis of technologies may somewhat undermine the needs. Third, effective e-course development should be the concerted efforts of both academic staff and IT staff. These would be illustrated and discussed.",

They jointly worked on the PEARL project (http://iet.open.ac.uk/pearl/) from 2000 to 2003 and have worked on further projects within their own institutions (the Open University, United Kingdom, and the University of Porto, Portugal, respectively) since then. The paper begins with a statement of the rationale for remote experiments, then offers a review of past work of the authors and highlights the key lessons for remote labs drawn from this. These lessons include (1) the importance of removing accessibility barriers, (2) the importance of a pedagogic strategy, (3) evaluation of pedagogic effectiveness, (4) the ease of automation or remote control, and (5) learning objectives and design decisions. The paper then discusses key topics including assessment issues, instructional design, pedagogical strategies, relations to industry, and cost benefits. A conclusion summarizes key points from the paper within a review of the current status of remote labs in education.",

The cost of such equipment is close to 1 million dollar, without taking into account the maintenance and attached human resources expenses to make it work properly daily. Although the sharing of such equipments seems to be obvious for education, the French experience is quite a unique example in the world. The paper introduces the context of industrial IC testing and justifies the introduction of labs in Electrical Engineering curricula. Practical information regarding IC testing and network setup for remote access are detailed, together with lab contents.",

We believe that PBL is well suited to educating undergraduate and graduate students within the interdisciplinary field of biomedical engineering (BME). BME draws upon many traditional disciplines to address a range of problems, from biotechnology to clinical medicine. A challenge for BME educators is to balance this broad base of fundamentals with the analytical, in depth problem solving necessary to be successful bioengineers. The ability to adapt, be innovative, and acquire and integrate relevant information is not efficiently learned in a lecture format, but rather in a small group setting that encourages self-directed learning, such as PBL. We have developed a graduate BME program with PBL as one of the pivotal components and are embarking on the introduction of this methodology to undergraduate sections. We have found PBL to be an effective vehicle for instruction, retention of material, and introduction of topics necessary for professional development.",

The aim of this paper was to illustrate how PBL has been used in electric power engineering education and what kinds of experiences have been reached. In the department of Electric Power Engineering at Tampere University of Technology (TUT), PBL was used for three different case exercises in the Energy Economics course. The problems of the cases were designed to correspond to real-life situations. To encourage the students to solve the cases they were given activity points to examination. The analysis of questionnaires, which were filled in by students, indicates that students liked problem-based learning as a teaching method and that PBL is worth further development.",

On that background the Global UICEE Centre for problem-based learning (UCPBL) is established. This paper describes the UCPBL profile and plan of action. The activities include consultancy for university organisations that are changing from a traditional educational concept to PBL concept, staff development on organisational level, educational level and pedagogical level, a PBL master programme and short courses. We are involved in (re)-organising universities in developing countries and focus on capacity building. Continuing professional development is also a natural task of the centre as one of more aspects of university-industry cooperation. In the paper and presentation we also mention the global aspect of our work and the establishment of the global network on problem based learning and how to be involved in this.",

It is the authors contention that traditional assessment techniques such as the familiar multiple-choice and true-false examinations do little to truly assess a students understanding and far-transfer of the PBL learning experience. Likewise evaluating the success of PBL as compared to more traditional lecture-based classes requires more complex techniques.",

The project is motivated by the desire to introduce students to self-directed independent learning and to learning in groups early in their programs, both of which concepts are, in theory, provided by team-based learning. Despite the potential benefits, several practical challenges have been encountered while attempting to implement the strategy. These include motivating students to study and learn new material outside of class and before encountering it in the classroom; and motivating them to follow a prescribed model of good group work. The paper describes progress in overcoming these and other challenges, and changes being implemented to improve the approach.",

The Electric Circuits Concept Inventory (ECCI) is a set of multiple choice questions that measures students understanding of DC Circuit analysis. The topics include (i) fundamental conceptual circuit topics (ii) Circuit laws and (iii) Circuit analysis techniques. In this paper, we develop a rationale for developing a repertoire of classic and representative set of problems that test the major concepts taught in a typical Electric Circuits course. We also present a set of multiple-choice questions suggested for inclusion in the ECCI focusing on the fundamental topics part of DC circuits analysis only. We examine the various concepts tested in each question and relate its importance to an overall course in Electric Circuits. We welcome more additions to this growing repertoire of questions that we plan to build and use in finalizing the ECCI test, especially in AC Circuit analysis topics.",

            "abstract" : "In electrical engineering programs, physical Laboratory courses should enable students to apply theory to design, to synthesize and analyze circuits and systems, and gain practical hands-on skills and knowledge required for their future career. However, students often have difficulty applying electrical theory to problem solving tasks, such as those encountered in lab experiments; therefore, an alternative approach to lab instruction is desirable. A study at Vanderbilt University explored the potential of organizing electrical engineering labs around challenges. A learning model called Software Technology for Assessment and Reflection (STAR) Legacy was adopted in designing the lab learning process. The model combines problem-solving challenges and instructional resources with Web-based technology. This paper describes the structure of the innovative challenge-based lab design, and presents student and instructor evaluations of this design.",

            "abstract" : "In problem-based learning and related approaches, a faculty member organizes course content around posing several situations to students and presenting them questions, challenges, problems, or projects drawn from the situation. A faculty member presents the problem and asks for student solution fragments before lecturing on relevant course content. Then, the faculty member facilitates student teams as they work through a process to answer the question. Content is selected, organized, and presented to help students address each posed challenge. Many studies have offered results that faculty members can use to evaluate the efficacy of a problem-based learning approach to teaching and decide whether to apply the approach for their courses. However, the proposed manuscript offers a different line of reasoning to advocate problem-based learning. Reasoning begins with a two-by-two, process-content matrix, which is very similar to the two-by-two, innovation-efficiency matrix used to characterize adaptive expertise. If student development were characterized as a trajectory in a two-dimensional, innovation-efficiency space, then questions such as the following could be raised: What characterizes more time-efficient trajectories to reach adaptive expertise? The proposed manuscript will use this line of reasoning to explore how problem-based learning may offer a time-efficient approach to developing adaptive expertise.",

            "abstract" : "A framework is presented for implementing feminist pedagogy along with demonstrative examples from engineering curricula. The framework for incorporating the values of feminism into the learning experience focuses on three aspects: 1) learning management strategies, 2) assessment and evaluation strategies and 3) strategies for critiquing existing power structures and the engineering process. Feminist pedagogy strategies suggested by others include cooperative learning, providing students a voice in classroom management decisions, structuring student interactions to facilitate all students participation, having students participate in designing evaluation rubrics and assigning projects that require more than technical skills. A unique feature which feminist pedagogy offers to engineering education is the critique of power structures in relation to the engineering process. For example, the following questions can be addressed: (a) How are engineering processes influenced by the historical frameworks of their development?; (b) How are decisions made?; (c) Who makes decisions?; (d) Who benefits from the decisions?; and (e) What values do they reflect?",

Such assessment inventories can play an important part in relating teaching techniques to student learning. Work first got started two years ago on CIs for the subjects of thermodynamics; solid mechanics; signals and processing; and electromagnetics. Last year work got underway on CIs for circuits; fluid mechanics; engineering materials; transport processes; and statistics. This year work began on chemistry; computer engineering; dynamics; electronics; and heat transfer. This panel session will discuss the progress on these concept inventories. More, importantly, the panelists will discuss the early student data that are emerging from the process of continuous improvement of the instruments. Results will be compared to the data collected by Hake that are segregated by how the content was managed and delivered (e.g., traditional lecture mode compared to the interactive engagement mode, as defined by Hake). Discussions of effective practices for use in the development of CIs will also be discussed.",

An instructor can give the FCI as both a pre-test and as a post-test to produce data that can be used in a continuous improvement manner to evaluate the effectiveness of various instructional strategies. This presentation reviews the development and history of the FCI from the standpoint of what makes it so effective for this use. This presentation is a lead-in to four new Concept Inventories, two in thermodynamics (one for a first year course and one for a second year course), one in signals and processing, and one in strength of materials. Other Concept Inventories are known to exist or are being created (e.g., wave phenomenon for electrical engineers and energy principles in physics).",

The assessment consists of administering the multiple choice signals and systems concept inventory (SSCI) as pretest and a post-test for the course. The SSCI data also show that students conceptual understanding at the end of continuous time courses is significantly correlated with their understanding at the start of a subsequent discrete time course, but not at the end of the discrete time course. Correlation of SSCI results with grades in prerequisite courses supports the notion that students learn signals and systems better when they have an adequate background in mathematics.",

These problems are called model-eliciting activities (MEAs), and they are based on the models and modeling perspective developed in mathematics education. Through a NSF-HRD gender equity project that has funded the development, use, and study of MEAs in undergraduate engineering courses for increasing womens interest in engineering, we have found that the MEA framework fosters significant change in the way engineering faculty think about their teaching and their students. In this paper, we will present the six principles that guide the development of an MEA, detail our motivation for using the MEA framework to construct open-ended problems, and discuss the opportunities and challenges to creating, implementing, and assessing MEAs.",

With the support of the National Science Foundation, model-eliciting activities (MEAs) were created and implemented with first-year engineering students at Purdue University. These tasks are open-ended modeling problems that introduce advanced engineering content yet are suitable for undergraduate engineering students. In this paper, we will give a personal account of the research and development of the nano roughness MEA. We will focus on the attainment of the six principles that guide the development of an MEA and the main development challenges: identifying aspects of an advanced engineering topic suitable for undergraduate students, making the task realistic, creating the need for team interaction, making the model reusable in similar situations, and preparing for task implementation in the classroom.",

Effective methods of displaying the 3D information in such images are essential to aid in both diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Two philosophically different approaches to the display problem have been pursued. In the first approach, 3D information is displayed as a distribution of densities in a 3D space. The second approach extracts, from slice images, information about boundary surfaces of objects which is displayed on a 2D screen. The present paper reviews both of these approaches with particular emphasis on the image and graphics processing aspects of the latter approach.",

The author then outlines the major features of an extension to the architecture that will permit the high-speed display and manipulation of multiple, independent, shaded three-dimensional objects represented as a voxel (volume-element) database with gray scale. The objective is to provide many useful capabilities at or near video rates facilitating extensive real-time interaction. The architecture is highly modular, permitting a cost tradeoff to be made to achieve a given level of performance. It also includes a great deal of regularity in its structure, making it directly suitable for VLSI implementation. A key feature is that no computational operations more complex than adds, shifts, and comparisons are required in real time. The display characteristics for each object are controlled by a concise object descriptor table, which contains all of the control parameters required to process that object.",

The modal expansion of the fields is complicated by the coupling of the basic modes by the imperfect walls. To avoid this difficulty, and in view of the large guide dimensions relative to the free space wavelength, a geometrical ray approach is proposed. To provide a theoretical foundation for the method, we first consider an idealized waveguide model with two perfectly reflecting side walls. The modal field expansion for this prototype model is fully analyzed to provide a satisfactory comparison between the modal and the geometrical ray sums. The proposed general ray method is then applied to the rectangular waveguide when all four walls are imperfectly conducting. Finally, the influence of wall roughness is considered by a relatively simple method.",

Theoretically predicted field strengths for surface to mine and mine to surface propagation are compared with measurements in coal mines in Colorado and Pennsylvania. It is concluded that surface-to-mine voice communication is practical using a horizontal wire antenna operating at audio frequencies, and that mine-to-surface interrupted CW signaling is practical using multiple-turn horizontal loop antennas. This research has resulted in an emergency through-the-earth communication system that is being evaluated by the U.S. Bureau of Mines for use in mine rescue operations.",

            "abstract" : "The effect of three I/O controller architectures on schedulable utilization, which is the highest attainable resource utilization at or below which all deadlines can be guaranteed, is examined. FIFO (first-in-first-out) request queuing, priority queuing, and priority queuing with preemptable service are simulated for a range of CPU computation to I/O traffic ratios. The results show that, for I/O-bound task sets and zero preemption costs, priority queuing with preemptable service can provide a level of schedulable utilization 35% higher than that attainable with FIFO queuing, and 20% higher than priority queuing and nonpreemptable service. Although the potential gain for priority queuing with preemptable service is large, further simulations that incorporate a time penalty for each preemption show that the gain is very sensitive to preemption cost. With preemption cost represented as a ratio of preemption time to the minimum-task period, the level of schedulable utilization for priority queuing with preemptable service degrades to that of priority queuing with nonpreemptible service, for a preemption cost ratio of 0.04. A high-level design of a preemptable I/O controller is described and the issues determining preemption cost are detailed, along with techniques for its minimization.",

Highly responsive guaranteed service is introduced for alert class asynchronous messages. Conventional use of the IEEE 802.5 token ring provides synchronous communication services using time-domain multiplexing (TDM) while relegating asynchronous class message services to background status. An algorithmic-based scheduling approach is presented that supports a priori schedulability determination for arbitrary synchronous message sets without the costly time-line development, testing, and tuning associated with TDM techniques. This capability allows the IEEE 802.5 to support dynamic, adaptive and reconfigurable run-time environments where the inflexibility of TDM would be prohibitive. Advanced real-time scheduling applied to the IEEE 802.5 token ring greatly enhances the responsiveness of asynchronous class messages while still maintaining guaranteed service for the synchronous class.",

We propose a dynamic real-time scheduling technique, called MART, in which it is also possible to change task characteristics. When MART is used in systems where task characteristics need to be and can be modified, it enables the system to be adaptable to changing environments dynamically and flexibly. By using MART, systems can accept on-line requirements such as changing task timing characteristics, and adding or deleting tasks. If a task set becomes unschedulable as a result of such modifications, MART can determine a schedulable task set. Though MART must adjust timing characteristics of other tasks to guarantee the schedulability of all tasks, the need for such adjustments is reduced. We also argue the importance of predictability in real-time computing, then improve the predictability of MART by introducing the notion of importance into each task. MART uses importance as a factor for task characteristic adjustment.",

The algorithm for jointly scheduling the periodic and aperiodic tasks extends the slack stealing algorithm introduced by Lehoczky and Ramos-Thuel (1992), and thus provides the largest amount of time for aperiodic task processing subject to meeting all periodic task deadlines. The analysis permits the periodic tasks to consist of a set of serially executed subtasks each of which has its own fixed execution priority as defined by (Gonzalez Harbour et al., (1991)) Thus the model permits the direct inclusion of operating system functions as well as certain types of synchronization protocols directly into the schedulability analysis. The methods provide a unified framework for dealing with several related problems including: reclaiming unused periodic and aperiodic execution time, load shedding, balancing hard and soft aperiodic execution time and coping with transient overloads.",

This puts the development and maintenance of real-time systems on an analytic, engineering basis making, these systems easier to develop and maintain.

            "abstract" : "We consider the problem of scheduling a set of n preemptable tasks in a system having r resources. Each task has an arbitrary, but known, worst case processing time and a deadline, and may request simultaneous use of a number of resources. A resource can be used either in shared mode or exclusive mode. In this paper, we develop and evaluate algorithms for determining whether or not a set of preemptive tasks is schedulable in such a real-time system, and if so, determining a schedule for it. This scheduling problem is known to be computationally intensive. In many real-time application environments, tasks are scheduled dynamically, and hence the scheduling algorithms used must have low run-time costs. To keep run-time costs low, we propose the use of suboptimal but practical algorithms that employ computationally simple heuristics. The computational complexity of our algorithms for scheduling n tasks in a system having r resources is O(rn<sup>2</sup>), which is very much lower than that of known optimal algorithms. We report on the results of simulation studies performed on such heuristic preemptive scheduling algorithms and the sensitivity of the performance of the algorithms with respect to various scheduling parameters. These studies show that due to the complexity of the problem, straightforward heuristics do not perform satisfactorily. However, an algorithm that uses combinations of such heuristics in conjunction with limited backtracks works very well.",

A deadline mechanism has been previously proposed to provide fault tolerance in real-time software systems. The mechanism trades the accuracy of the results of a service for timing precision. Two independent algorithms are provided for each service subject to a deadline. The primary algorithm produces a good quality service, although its real-time reliability may not be assured. The alternate algorithm is reliable and produces an acceptable response. An algorithm to generate an optimal schedule for the deadline mechanism is introduced, and a simple and efficient implementation is discussed. The schedule ensures the timely completion of the alternate algorithm despite a failure to complete the primary algorithm within real time.",

            "abstract" : "Cache memories are commonly avoided in real time systems because of their unpredictable behavior. Recently, some research has been done to obtain tighter bounds on the worst case execution time (WCET) of cached programs. These techniques usually assume a non preemptive underlying system. However, some techniques can be applied to allow the use of caches in preemptive systems. The paper describes how to incorporate the effect of instruction cache to the Response Time schedulability Analysis (RTA). RTA is an efficient analysis for preemptive fixed priority schedulers. We also compare through simulations the results of such an approach to both cache partitioning (increase of the cache predictability by assigning private cache partitions to tasks) and CRMA (Cached RMA: cache effect is incorporated in the utilization based rate monotonic schedulability analysis). The results show that the cached version of RTA (CRTA) clearly outperforms CRMA, however the partitioning scheme may be better depending on the system configuration. The obtained results bound the applicability domain for each method for a variety of hardware and workload configurations. The results can be used as design guidelines.",

The method is based on traditional real time CPU Response Time Analysis (RTA), and is intended to be used for admission control of hard real time traffic. The method determines if a new connection can be admitted without violating the strict timing requirements specified for the new as well as old connections. We illustrate the merits of our method by comparing it with Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) and the Calculus for Network Delays (CND). Two types of comparisons are made. In the first, we evaluate how well the associated analysis can accommodate different traffic scenarios and loads, and in the second comparison we use simulation to compare observed worst case behaviors with estimates obtained by the analysis. The comparisons clearly indicate that RTA outperforms both WFQ and CND for a set of realistic traffic scenarios.",

The proposed technique consists of two steps. The first step performs a per-task analysis to estimate cache-related preemption cost for each execution point in a given task from the number of useful cache blocks at the execution point. The second step computes the worst case response time of each task using a response time equation and a linear programming technique which takes as its input the preemption cost information of tasks obtained in the first step. Our experimental results show that the proposed technique gives a prediction of the worst case cache-related preemption delay that is up to 60% tighter than that obtained from previous approaches.",

The network is assumed to be a virtual circuit, connection-based packet network. It is shown that the use of generalized processor sharing (GPS), when combined with leaky bucket admission control, allows the network to make a wide range of worst-case performance guarantees on throughput and delay. The scheme is flexible in that different users may be given widely different performance guarantees and is efficient in that each of the servers is work conserving. The authors present a practical packet-by-packet service discipline, PGPS that closely approximates GPS. This allows them to relate results for GPS to the packet-by-packet scheme in a precise manner. The performance of a single-server GPS system is analyzed exactly from the standpoint of worst-case packet delay and burstiness when the sources are constrained by leaky buckets. The worst-case session backlogs are also determined.",

            "abstract" : "Worst-case bounds on delay and backlog are derived for leaky bucket constrained sessions in arbitrary topology networks of generalized processor sharing (GPS) servers. The inherent flexibility of the service discipline is exploited to analyze broad classes of networks. When only a subset of the sessions are leaky bucket constrained, we give succinct per-session bounds that are independent of the behavior of the other sessions and also of the network topology. However, these bounds are only shown to hold for each session that is guaranteed a backlog clearing rate that exceeds the token arrival rate of its leaky bucket. A much broader class of networks, called consistent relative session treatment (CRST) networks is analyzed for the case in which all of the sessions are leaky bucket constrained. First, an algorithm is presented that characterizes the internal traffic in terms of average rate and burstiness, and it is shown that all CRST networks are stable. Next, a method is presented that yields bounds on session delay and backlog given this internal traffic characterization. The links of a route are treated collectively, yielding tighter bounds than those that result from adding the worst-case delays (backlogs) at each of the links in the route. The bounds on delay and backlog for each session are efficiently computed from a universal service curve, and it is shown that these bounds are achieved by staggered greedy regimes when an independent sessions relaxation holds. Propagation delay is also incorporated into the model. Finally, the analysis of arbitrary topology GPS networks is related to Packet GPS networks (PGPS). The PGPS scheme was first proposed by Demers, Shenker and Keshav (1991) under the name of weighted fair queueing. For small packet sizes, the behavior of the two schemes is seen to be virtually identical, and the effectiveness of PGPS in guaranteeing worst-case session delay is demonstrated under certain assignments.",

Although there has been some work on the analysis of communication protocols, most of this is for idealised networks. Experience with single-processor scheduling analysis has shown that models which abstract away from implementation details are at best very pessimistic, and at worst lead to an unschedulable system being deemed schedulable. In this paper, we derive an idealised scheduling analysis for the CAN real-time bus, and then study two actual interface chips to see how the analysis can be applied.",

            "abstract" : "In this paper we propose a novel schedulability analysis for verifying the feasibility of large periodic task sets under the rate monotonic algorithm, when the exact test cannot be applied on line due to prohibitively long execution times. The proposed test has the same complexity as the original Liu and Layland bound but it is less pessimistic, so allowing to accept task sets that would be rejected using the original approach. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated with respect to the classical Liu and Layland method, and theoretical bounds are derived as a function of n (the number of tasks) and for the limit case of n tending to infinity. The analysis is also extended to include aperiodic servers and blocking times due to concurrency control protocols. Extensive simulations on synthetic tasks sets are presented to compare the effectiveness of the proposed test with respect to the Liu and Layland method and the exact response time analysis.",

            "abstract" : "Most existing scheduling algorithms for hard real-time systems apply either to periodic tasks or aperiodic tasks but not to both. In practice, real-time systems require an integrated, consistent approach to scheduling that is able to simultaneously meet the timing requirements of hard deadline periodic tasks, hard deadline aperiodic (alert-class) tasks, and soft deadline aperiodic tasks. This paper introduces the Deferrable Server (DS) algorithm which will be shown to provide improved aperiodic response time performance over traditional background and polling approaches. Taking advantage of the fact that, typically, there is no benefit in early completion of the periodic tasks, the Deferrable Server (DS) algorithm assigns higher priority to the aperiodic tasks up until the point where the periodic tasks would start to miss their deadlines. Guaranteed alert-class aperiodic service and greatly reduced response times for soft deadline aperiodic tasks are important features of the DS algorithm, and both are obtained with the hard deadlines of the periodic tasks still being guaranteed. The results of a simulation study performed to evaluate the response time performance of the new algorithm against traditional background and polling approaches are presented. In all cases, the response times of aperiodic tasks are significantly reduced (often by an order of magnitude) while still maintaining guaranteed periodic task deadlines.",

With or without stack sharing, the SRP offers the following improvements over the PCP: (1) it unifies the treatment of stack, reader-writer, multiunit resources, and binary semaphores; (2) it applies directly to some dynamic scheduling policies, including earliest deadline first (EDF), as well as to static priority policies; (3) with EDF scheduling, it supports a stronger schedulability test; and (4) it reduces the maximum number of context switches for a job execution request by a factor of two. It is at least as good as the PCP in reducing maximum priority inversion.",

Any practical scheduling algorithm for assigning real-time tasks to a multiprocessor system presents a trade-off between its computational complexity and its performance. In this study, new schedulability conditions are presented for homogeneous multiprocessor systems where individual processors execute the rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm. The conditions are used to develop new strategies for assigning real-time tasks to processors. The performance of the new strategies is shown to be significantly better than suggested by the existing literature.

            "abstract" : "We present a user-controllable, general-purpose, pseudorandom task graph generator called Task Graphs For Free (TGFF). TGFF creates problem instances for use in allocation and scheduling research. It has the ability to generate independent tasks as well as task sets which are composed of partially ordered task graphs. A complete description of a scheduling problem instance is created, including attributes for processors, communication resources, tasks, and inter-task communication. The user may parametrically control the correlations between attributes. Sharing TGFFs parameter settings allows researchers to easily reproduce the examples used by others, regardless of the platform on which TGFF is run.",

This paper describes a performance analysis algorithm for a set of tasks executing on a heterogeneous distributed system. Tight bounds are essential to the synthesis and verification of application-specific distributed systems, such as embedded computing systems. Our bounding algorithms are valid for a general problem model: The system can contain several tasks with hard real-time deadlines and different periods; each task is partitioned into a set of processes related by data dependencies. The periods of tasks and the computation times of processes are not necessarily constant and can be specified by a lower bound and an upper bound. Such a model requires a more sophisticated algorithm, but leads to more accurate results than previous work. Our algorithm both provides tighter bounds and is faster than previous methods.",

We outine the hardware that would be required to build a 4096 processor system using 1990s technology. We also discuss system software issues, and present analytic studies of the network performance.

Directory schemes for cache coherence are potentially attractive in large multiprocessor systems that are beyond the scaling limits of the snoopy cache schemes. Slight modifications to directory schemes can make them competitive in performance with snoopy cache schemes for small multiprocessors. Trace-driven simulation, using data collected from several real multiprocessor applications, is used to compare the performance of standard directory schemes, modifications to these schemes, and snoopy cache protocols. In addition, the simulations show that most blocks that are written into are present in only a small number of other caches, which makes broadcast invalidates inefficient. This result suggests that a directory structure that stores with each block only a small number of pointers to caches containing the block is sufficient.",

Both directory methods are modifications of a scheme proposed by L.M. Censier and P. Feautrier (1978) that does not rely on a specific interconnection network and can be readily distributed across interleaved main memory. The schemes considered here overcome the large amount of memory required for tags in the original scheme in two different ways. In the first scheme each main memory block is sectored into sub-blocks for which the large tag overhead is shared. In the second scheme a limited number of large tags are stored in an associative cache and shared among a much larger number of main memory blocks. Simulations show that in terms of access time and network traffic both directory methods provide significant performance improvements over a memory system in which shared-writable data are not cached. The large block sizes required for the sectored scheme, however, promote sufficient false sharing for its performance to be markedly worse than when a tag cache is used.",

The problem is closely examined in this paper and previous solutions, both centralized approaches and distributed approaches, are analyzed based on the notion of semicritical sections. A state model is then presented which clarifies various coherence mechanisms as well as introduces a new state to enable the multicache system to more efficiently handle the processor writes. Software guidance, for performance and not for integrity, is advocated in a new proposal which in a practical multicache environment explores the benefit of the new state with little cost.",

            "abstract" : "Parallel execution of programs requires more resources and more complex resource management than sequential execution. If concurrent tasks can be spawned dynamically, programs may require an inordinate amount of resources when the potential parallelism in the program is much greater than the amount of parallelism the machine can utilize. Loop bounding, a technique for dynamically controlling the amount of parallelism exposed in dataflow programs, is described. The effectiveness of the technique in reducing token storage requirements is supported by experimental data in the form of parallelism profiles and waiting-token profiles. Comparisons are made throughout with more conventional approaches to parallel computing. It is shown that limiting the maximum number of coherent iterations of loops is effective in reducing the resource requirements of typical scientific programs without sacrificing performance. The implementation of this idea is based on compiling loops into dataflow graphs with a loop-bounding parameter than can be set at run time according to some policy.",

However, the proposed mechanisms are complex and introduce new mapping complications. A greatly simplified approach to data-flow execution, called the explicit token store (ETS) architecture, and its current realization in Monsoon are presented. The essence of dynamic data-flow execution is captured by a simple transition on state bits associated with storage local to a processor. Low-level storage management is performed by the compiler in assigning nodes to slots in an activation frame, rather than dynamically in hardware. The processor is simple, highly pipelined, and quite general. It may be viewed as a generalization of a fairly primitive von Neumann architecture. Although the addressing capability is restrictive, there is exactly one instruction executed for each action on the data-flow graph. Thus, the machine-originated ETS model provides new understanding of the merits and the real cost of direct execution of data-flow graphs.",

Many researchers have addressed the issues of time efficiency vs. accuracy by using simpler device models and by simplifying the numerical algorithms. StepWise Equivalent Conductance (SWEC) simulation technique is an alternative which approximates the nonlinear transfer characteristic of the transistor with stepwise constant conductances. The authors demonstrate that the time step can be controlled to provide the necessary accuracy in the implicit integration algorithm. A timing simulator has been built based on this principle. The simulator can handle very large CMOS designs. Comparisons have been made with XPsim and SPECS2 using several examples. The results indicate that SWEC exhibits far better efficiency and accuracy.",

The embedded system is represented by a set of finite domain constraints defining different requirements on process timing, system resources and interprocess communication. The assignment of processes to processors and interprocess communications to buses as well as their scheduling are then defined as an optimization problem. A prototype system, based on constraint solving techniques, has been implemented in CHIP 5, the constraint logic programming system. Experimental results show that this approach can be efficiently used to define different system constraints and generate optimized system implementations.",

Evaluating architectures is difficult for two main reasons. First, there is no common language used to describe different architectures. Second, there is no clear way of understanding an architecture with respect to an organizations life cycle concerns -software quality concerns such as maintainability portability, modularity, reusability, and so forth. We address these shortcomings by describing three perspectives by which we can understand the description of a software architecture and then proposing a five-step method for analyzing software architectures called SAAM (Software Architecture Analysis Method). We illustrate the method by analyzing three separate user interface architectures with respect to the quality of modifiability.",

It enable a user to prepare, analyze, and debug diagrammatic, yet precise, descriptions of the system under development from three interrelated points of view, capturing, respectively, structure, functionality, and behavior. These views are represented by three graphical languages, the most intricate of which is the language of state charts used to depict reactive behavior over time. In addition to use of state charts, the main novelty of STATEMATE is in the fact that it understands the entire descriptions perfectly, to the point of being able to analyze them for crucial dynamic properties, to carry out rigorous animated executions and simulations of the described system, and to create running code automatically.",

The semantics of Modechart is given in terms of real-time logic (RTL), which is especially amenable to reasoning about the absolute (real-time clock) timing of events. The semantics of Modechart has an important property that the translation of a Modechart specification into RTL formulas results in a hierarchical organization of the resulting RTL assertions. This gives us significant leverage in reasoning about properties of a system by allowing us to filter out assertions that concern lower levels of abstraction. Some results about desirable properties of Modechart specifications are given. A graphical implementation of Modechart has been completed.",

Rapide is a concurrent event-based simulation language for defining and simulating the behavior of system architectures. Rapide is intended for modelling the architectures of concurrent and distributed systems, both hardware and software in order to represent the behavior of distributed systems in as much detail as possible. Rapide is designed to make the greatest possible use of event-based modelling by producing causal event simulations. When a Rapide model is executed it produces a simulation that shows not only the events that make up the models behavior, and their timestamps, but also which events caused other events, and which events happened independently. The architecture definition features of Rapide are described: event patterns, interfaces, architectures and event pattern mappings. The use of these features to build causal event models of both static and dynamic architectures is illustrated by a series of simple examples from both software and hardware. Also we give a detailed example of the use of event pattern mappings to define the relationship between two architectures at different levels of abstraction. Finally, we discuss briefly how Rapide is related to other event-based languages.",

The structure of this decomposition and interconnection is separable from the protocols (types and sequencing) of communication. A language for specifying this structure and a toolset for checking consistency between structure specifications and code would provide substantial benefits to practicing industrial software architects. Gestalt is an architecture language for specifying structure, with separate, partial support for protocol specifications. The Gestalt toolset checks structural consistency between the architecture and the code. It specifies and checks protocol type compatibility at the interfaces, using the implementation language and tools (e.g. compiler). It provides annotation support for sequencing and other architectural information.",

These views are represented by three graphical languages, the most intricate of which is the language of statecharts, used to depict reactive behavior over time. In addition to the use of statecharts, the main novelty of STATEMATE is in the fact that it understands the entire descriptions perfectly, to the point of being able to analyze them for crucial dynamic properties, to carry out rigorous executions and simulations of the described system, and to create running code automatically.

            "abstract" : "Recent advances in the analysis of distributed realtime systems have made it possible to predict if hard realtime requirements will be met. However, it is still difficult to find a feasible priority assignment when the utilization levels of the CPUs and communication networks are pushed near to their limits. This paper presents a new heuristic algorithm for optimizing the assignment of priorities to tasks and messages in distributed hard realtime systems. The algorithm is based on the knowledge of the parameters that influence the worst-case response time of a distributed application. This algorithm is compared to simulated annealing, which is a general optimization technique for discrete functions that had been previously used for solving similar problems. On average, our heuristic algorithm executes two orders of magnitude faster than simulated annealing, finds better solutions, and finds solutions in cases where the latter method fails.",

            "abstract" : "The stochastic process-algebra modelling paradigm has been introduced recently as an extension of classical process algebras with timing information aiming mainly at the integration of functional design with quantitative analysis of computer systems. Time is represented by exponentially distributed random variables that are assigned to each activity in the model. Thus, the semantic model of a stochastic process-algebra model can easily be transformed into a continuous time Markov chain which is suitable for computing performance measures as well as dependability measures. The main problem that one encounters frequently in Markov based modelling is the problem of having to solve a huge and stiff Markov chain. In dependability modelling, largeness is caused by lots of detailed and sometimes surplus information stored in the high level model. Stiff Markov chains result when one uses performance related activities together with reliability events in the same model. Various methods to tackle these problems are known, among them the concept of lumpability and decomposition techniques. Recent results in the area of stochastic process algebras have shown that their theoretical foundations can be related to these concepts. This makes it possible to provide access to these powerful techniques to modellers without requiring a very deeply technical knowledge.",

In most cases, these results provide little more than a yes or no answer. In practice, it is also useful to know how sensitive scheduling feasibility is to changes in the characteristics of the task set. This paper presents algorithms that allow a system developer to determine, for fixed-priority preemptive scheduling of hard real-time periodic tasks on a uniprocessor, how sensitive schedule feasibility is to changes in the computation times of various software components. The algorithms allow a system developer to determine what changes in task computation times can be made while preserving schedule feasibility (or what changes are needed to achieve feasibility). Both changes to the computation time of a single task and changes to the computation times of a specified subset of the tasks are analyzable.

For specifications, the syntax of CTL is extended to allow quantitative temporal operators. The formulas of the resulting logic, TCTL, are interpretation over continuous computation trees, trees in which paths are maps from the set of nonnegative reals to system states. To model finite-state systems the notion of timed graphs is introduced-state-transition graphs extended with a mechanism that allows the expression of constant bounds on the delays between the state transition. As the main result, an algorithm is developed for model checking, that is, for determining the truth of a TCTL formula with respect to a timed graph. It is argued that choosing a dense domain, instead of a discrete domain, to model time does not blow up the complexity of the model-checking problem. On the negative side, it is shown that the denseness of the underlying time domain makes TCTL II/sub 1//sup 1/-hard. The question of deciding whether a given TCTL formula is implementable by a timed graph is also undecidable.",

            "abstract" : "We propose and analyze a proportional share resource allocation algorithm for realizing real-time performance in time-shared operating systems. Processes are assigned a weight which determines a share (percentage) of the resource they are to receive. The resource is then allocated in discrete-sized time quanta in such a manner that each process makes progress at a precise, uniform rate. Proportional share allocation algorithms are of interest because: they provide a natural means of seamlessly integrating real and non-real-time processing; they are easy to implement; they provide a simple and effective means of precisely controlling the real-time performance of a process; and they provide a natural means of policing so that processes that use more of a resource than they request have no ill-effect on well-behaved processes. We analyze our algorithm in the context of an idealized system in which a resource is assumed to be granted in arbitrarily small intervals of time and show that our algorithm guarantees that the difference between the service time that a process should receive and the service time it actually receives is optimally bounded by the size of a time quantum. In addition, the algorithm provides support for dynamic operations, such as processes joining or leaving the competition, and for both fractional and non-uniform time quanta. As a proof of concept we have implemented a prototype of a CPU scheduler under FreeBSD. The experimental results shows that our implementation performs within the theoretical bounds and hence supports real-time execution in a general purpose operating system.",

            "abstract" : "The problem of fixed priority scheduling of periodic tasks where each tasks execution priority may vary is considered. Periodic tasks are decomposed into serially executed subtasks, where each subtask is characterized by an execution time and a fixed priority and is permitted to have a deadline. A method for determining the schedulability of each task is presented along with its theoretical underpinnings. This method can be used to analyze the schedulability of complex task sets which involve interrupts, certain synchronization protocols, nonpreemptible sections and, in general, any mechanism that contributes to a complex priority structure. The authors introduce a simple but realistic real-time robotics application and illustrate how one uses the schedulability equations presented.",

            "abstract" : "Scheduling theory holds great promise as a means to a priori validate timing correctness of real-time applications. However, there currently exists a wide gap between scheduling theory and its implementation in operating system kernels running on specific hardware platforms. The implementation of any particular scheduling algorithm introduces overhead and blocking components which must be accounted for in the timing correctness validation process. This paper presents a methodology for incorporating the costs of scheduler implementation within the context of fixed priority scheduling algorithms. Both event-driven and timer-driven scheduling implementations are analyzed. We show that for the timer-driven scheduling implementations the selection of the timer interrupt rate can dramatically affect the schedulability of a task set, and we present a method for determining the optimal timer rate. We analyzed both randomly generated and two well-defined task sets and found that their schedulability can be significantly degraded by the implementation costs. Task sets that have ideal breakdown utilization over 90% may not even be schedulable when the implementation costs are considered. This work provides a first step toward bridging the gap between real-time scheduling theory and implementation realities. This gap must be bridged for any meaningful validation of timing correctness properties of real-time applications.",

            "abstract" : "The issue of using the sporadic server (SS) for scheduling aperiodic tasks has received new attention under the POSIX standard as it has been proposed in P1003.1 d, the additional real-time extensions to POSIX. The SS has been traditionally considered a better approach to the deferrable server (DS) due to its supposed higher achievable utilisation. However, SS also has higher implementation complexity. Nevertheless, the analysis of the comparisons performed from several authors between DS and SS is not conclusive. A review on fixed priority servers is presented with a new parameter selection technique and comprehensive performance analysis based on simulation techniques. With this parameter selection, it is shown that no server performs significantly better than the other in most of the situations. This suggests that future POSIX revisions for real-time support should also consider mechanisms by which other types of servers could be implemented.",

            "abstract" : "Feasibility analysis of fixed priority systems has been widely studied in the real-time literature and several acceptance tests have been proposed to guarantee a set of periodic tasks. They can be divided into two main classes: polynomial time tests and exact tests. Polynomial time tests are used for an online guarantee of dynamic systems, where tasks can be activated at runtime. These tests introduce negligible overhead when executed on a new task arrival, but provide only a sufficient schedulability condition, which may cause poor processor utilization. On the other hand, exact tests, which are based on response time analysis, provide a necessary and sufficient schedulability condition, but are too complex to be executed on line for large task sets. As a consequence, for large task sets, they are often executed offline. This paper proposes a novel approach for analyzing the schedulability of periodic task sets under rate monotonic priority assignment. Using this approach, we derive a new schedulability test which can be tuned through a parameter to balance the complexity vs. acceptance ratio, so that it can be used online to better exploit the processor based on available computational power. Extensive simulations show that our test, when used in its exact form, is significantly faster than current response time analysis methods. Moreover, the proposed approach, for its elegance and compactness, offers an explanation of known phenomena of fixed priority scheduling and could be helpful for further work on rate monotonic analysis.",

            "abstract" : "While there is currently great interest in the problem of providing real time services in general purpose operating systems, the issue of real time scheduling of internal operating system activities has received relatively little attention. Without such real time scheduling, the system is susceptible to conditions such as receive livelock-a situation in which an operating system spends all its time processing arriving network packets, and application processes, even if scheduled with a real time scheduler, are starved. We investigate the problem of scheduling operating system activities such as network protocol processing in a proportional share manner. We describe a proportional share implementation of the FreeBSD operating system and demonstrate that it solves the receive livelock problem. Packets are processed within the operating system only at the cumulative rate at which the destination applications are prepared to receive them. If packets arrive at a faster rate then they are discarded after consuming minimal system resources. In this manner the performance of well behaved applications is unaffected by misbehaving applications. We demonstrate this effect by running a set of multimedia applications under a variety of network conditions on a set of increasingly sophisticated proportional share implementations of FreeBSD and comparing their performance. This work contributes to our knowledge of the engineering of proportional share real time systems.",

            "abstract" : "This paper extends the useful concept of open systems proposed by W.S. Liu, et al. (1997) in scheduling real-time applications and non-real-time applications, where the schedulability of each real-time application can be validated independently of other applications in the system. We replace the underlying earliest-deadline-first OS scheduler of the open system architecture by W.S. Liu, et al. (1997) with a rate-monotonic OS scheduler. The motivation behind this work is that many existing operating systems may not support the earliest deadline first scheduling very well. We propose to use the idea of sporadic servers to preserve CPU cycles for applications. We also develop schedulability tests for real-time applications which adopt the rate monotonic scheduling algorithm, the earliest deadline first scheduling algorithm, the priority ceiling protocol, and the stack resource policy. We allow tasks in each application to share local and global non-preemptable resources. A global resource synchronization mechanism is proposed. This paper provides a fixed-priority-based alternative for the important open system architecture.",

Given a multiset of positive integers (instance) A=(a/sub 1/, . . . a/sub n/), the problem is to find an infinite sequence (schedule) of symbols from (1,2, . . . n) such that there is at least one symbol i within any interval of a/sub i/ symbols (slots). Not all instances A can be scheduled; for example, no successful schedule exists for instances whose density is larger than 1. It has been shown that any instance whose density is less than 2/3 can always be scheduled. Two new schedulers are proposed which improve this 2/3 result to a new 0.7 density threshold. These two schedulers can be viewed as a generalization of the previously known schedulers, i.e. they can handle a larger class of pinwheel instances including all instances schedulable by the previously known techniques.",

A ground station receiving from several such satellites and wishing to avoid data loss faces a real-time scheduling problem. The pinwheel is a formalization of this problem. Given a multiset A of integers=(a/sub 1/, a/sub 2/, . . ., a/sub n/), a successful schedule S is an infinite sequence over (1, 2, . . ., n) such that any subsequence of a/sub i/ (1<or=i<or=n) consecutive entries (slots) contains at least one i.

The authors present a pinwheel scheduler Sr/sup b/ which is derived from Sr using any base greater than or equal to d.

We present and prove a delay guarantee for the virtual clock service discipline (inspired by time division multiplexing). The guarantee has several desirable properties, including the following firewall property: the guarantee to a flow is unaffected by the behavior of other flows sharing the same server. There is no assumption that sources are flow controlled or well behaved. We first introduce and define the concept of an active flow. The delay guarantee is then formally stated as a theorem.

            "abstract" : "The generalized pinwheel scheduling problem is defined as follows: Given a multiset {(a/sub 1/, b/sub 1/), (a/sub 2/, b/sub 2/), ..., (a/sub n/, b/sub n/)} of ordered pairs of positive integers, determine whether there is an infinite sequence over the symbols {1, 2, 3, ..., n} such that, for each i, 1/spl les/i/spl les/n, any subsequence of b/sub i/ consecutive symbols contains at least a/sub i/ is. Such an infinite sequence is called a schedule for the generalized pin wheel task system {(a/sub 1/, b/sub 1/), (a/sub 2/, b/sub 2/), ..., (a/sub n/, b/sub n/)}. When all the a/sub i/s are equal to one, this problem has been previously studied as the pinwheel scheduling problem. A linear-time algorithm is presented for solving such instances which determines whether such an instance has a schedule. A fast on-line scheduler (FOLS) is also derived, which can actually generate the schedule in O(log n) time per slot given O(n) preprocessing time. When compared to traditional pinwheel scheduling algorithms, this new algorithm has a higher density threshold on a very large subclass of generalized pinwheel task systems.",

Schedulers in complex systems must be designed to manage a set of applications developed and deployed independently. We study an open real-time environment architecture for distributed systems where real-time applications may run concurrently with non-real-time applications. The architecture uses a two-level scheduling scheme. Each application is assigned a sporadic server to schedule the processes in the application. All sporadic servers are then scheduled by a system-wide fixed priority scheduler. Using the proposed open environment architecture, all hard real-time applications are guaranteed to have their reserved CPU utilization in order to meet all their deadlines. The guarantee is independent of the behaviors of all other applications in the same system. We present the schedulability analysis methods on systems with or without shared memory.",

The scheme allows the developer of each real-time application to validate the schedulability of the application as if it were running alone on slower dedicated processors and network. A simple acceptance test is provided. According to the test, the operating system can determine whether to admit a new real-time system application into a system without having to perform detailed global schedulability analysis. Simulation results show that the hierarchical scheduling scheme outperforms the corresponding one-level heuristic algorithms. An open system prototype on a Myrinet cluster PCs running Windows NT uses this hierarchical scheme.",

            "abstract" : "Advances in the computer technology encouraged the avionics industry to replace the federated design of control units with an integrated suite of control modules that share the computing resources. The new approach, which is called integrated modular avionics (IMA), can achieve substantial cost reduction in the development, operation and maintenance of airplanes. A set of guidelines has been developed by the avionics industry to facilitate the development and certification of integrated systems. Among them, a software architecture is recommended to address real time and fault tolerance requirements. According to the architecture, applications are classified into partitions supervised by an operating system executive. A general purpose application/executive (APEX) interface is defined which identifies the minimum functionality provided to the application software of an IMA system. To support the temporal partitioning between applications, APEX interface requires a deterministic cyclic scheduling of partitions at the O/S level and a fixed priority scheduling among processes within each partition. We propose a scheduling scheme for partitions in APEX. The scheme determines the frequency that each partition must be invoked and the assignment of processor capacity on every invocation. Then, a cyclic schedule at the O/S level can be constructed and all processes within each partition can meet their deadline requirements.",

The proposed scheduling algorithm can be applied in a wide range of different situations, such as in a multimedia real-time systems, where applications may require a guaranteed level of Quality of Service, or in a network link, where different flows of packets may require a certain level of service. This algorithm does not require the exact knowledge of the service times and interarrival times of the tasks: hence, it is especially suited for soft real-time and multimedia environments.",

Layland (1973) assumes a worst case execution time bound for every task and may be too pessimistic if the worst case execution time of a task is much longer than the average. We give a multiframe real time task model which allows the execution time of a task to vary from one instance to another by specifying the execution time of a task in terms of a sequence of numbers. We investigate the schedulability problem for this model for the preemptive fixed priority scheduling policy. We show that a significant improvement in the utilization bound can be established in our model.",

Although various polynomial-time schedulability tests have been proposed, they often fail to decide the schedulability of the system precisely when the system is heavily loaded. This paper presents efficient online schedulability tests which are are shown to be more precise and efficient than any existing polynominal-time schedulability tests. Moreover, our proposed tests can be used for the multiframe model, where a task may have different computation times in different periods. We show the performance of the proposed schedulability tests in several simulation experiments.",

            "abstract" : "In this paper, issues involved in the design of a real-time database which maintains data temporal consistency are discussed. The concept of data-deadline is introduced and time cognizant non-waiting transaction scheduling policies are proposed. Further, two time cognizant forced wait policies which improve performance significantly by forcing a transaction to delay further execution until a new version of sensor data becomes available are proposed. A way to exploit temporal data similarity to improve performance is also proposed. Finally, these policies are evaluated through detailed simulation experiments. The simulation results show that taking advantage of temporal data semantics in transaction scheduling can significantly improve the performance of user transactions in real-time database systems. In particular, it is demonstrated that under the forced wait policy, the performance can be improved significantly. Further improvements result by exploiting data similarity.",

            "abstract" : "Scheduling periodic hard real time tasks is of great importance to many real time applications, such as open architecture machine tool controllers and avionic systems. The rate monotonic scheduling algorithm has been proven to provide an optimal static priority assignment under idealized conditions. However some of these conditions are not met in a real computer system. In particular the release times of tasks can deviate from the specified time instants because of operating system software timer unpredictability. We investigate the timer behaviors in three commercial real time operating systems, VxWorks, QNX and pSOSystem. Based on our findings, we propose an empirical task schedulability model, called RMTU (Rate Monotonic in the presence of Timing Unpredictability), to augment the rate monotonic scheduling theory in order to handle timing unpredictability. We then design an approach to systematically derive the model parameters by measurements. With RMTU, task deadlines can be empirically guaranteed. The validity of RMTU is supported by our measurement data. These results are useful not only to control application developers, but also to real time practitioners at large.",

The SRT system supports multiple CPU service classes for the real time processes based on their processor usage pattern including periodic constant processing time class (PCPT) and periodic variable processing time (PVPT) class. It also provides the following features: reservation and processing time guarantees for the service classes; overrun protection and scheduling algorithm; and system-initiated adaptation strategies. The other unique feature of the SRT system is its easy portability to any operating systems with real time extensions because it is implemented purely in the user space without any modifications to the kernel. We have implemented the SRT system on the Solaris 2.6 operating system with scheduling overhead under 400us and with good performance guarantees.",

            "abstract" : "This paper analyzes the results of two case studies in applying the Rialto/NT scheduler to real Windows 2000 applications. The first study is of a soft modem-a modem whose signal processing work is performed on the host CPU, rather than on a dedicated signal processing chip. The second is of an audio player application. Both of these are frequently used real-time applications-ones running on systems that were not designed to support predictable real-time execution. To function correctly, both applications require that ongoing computations be performed in a timely manner. In both cases, we first measured an original version designed to run on Windows 2000, and then modified the application to take advantage of ongoing CPU reservations provided by the Rialto/NT scheduler. We report on the benefits and problems observed when using reservations in these real-world scenarios. In both cases, we found that a real-time scheduler can provide the needed predictability for the application in the presence of competing applications, while also providing other benefits, such as minimizing the soft modems impact on the scheduling predictability of other computations in the system. We also describe the methodologies we used to analyze the real-time behavior of the operating system and applications during these studies, including the use of instrumented kernels to produce execution traces.",

Among them, the most commonly used paradigms include priority-driven, time-driven and share-driven paradigms. In this paper, we present a general scheduling framework which is designed to integrate these paradigms in one framework. The framework is implemented in our real-time extension of the Linux kernel, RED-Linux. Two scheduler components are used in the framework: Allocator and Dispatcher. For each job, the framework identifies four scheduling attributes: priority, start time, finish time and budget. We show that the framework can be used to efficiently implement many well-known scheduling algorithms. We also measure and analyze the performance of the framework implemented in RED-Linux.",

            "abstract" : "In a hard real-time system, it is assumed that no deadline is missed, whereas, in a soft or firm real-time system, deadlines can be missed, although this usually happens in a nonpredictable way. However, most hard real-time systems could miss some deadlines provided that it happens in a known and predictable way. Also, adding predictability on the pattern of missed deadlines for soft and firm real-time systems is desirable, for instance, to guarantee levels of quality of service. We introduce the concept of weakly hard real-time systems to model real-time systems that can tolerate a clearly specified degree of missed deadlines. For this purpose, we define four temporal constraints based on determining a maximum number of deadlines that can be missed during a window of time (a given number of invocations). This paper provides the theoretical analysis of the properties and relationships of these constraints. It also shows the exact conditions under which a constraint is harder to satisfy than another constraint. Finally, results on fixed priority scheduling and response-time schedulability tests for a wide range of process models are presented.",

            "abstract" : "The problem of scheduling multiple streams of real-time customers, is addressed in this paper. The paper first introduces the notion of (m, k)-firm deadlines to better characterize the timing constraints of real-time streams. More specifically, a stream is said to have (m, k)-firm deadlines if at least m out of any k consecutive customers must meet their deadlines. A stream with (m, k)-firm deadlines experiences a dynamic failure if fewer than m out of any k consecutive customers meet their deadlines. The paper then proposes a priority-based policy for scheduling N such streams on a single server to reduce the probability of dynamic failure. The basic idea is to assign higher priorities to customers from streams that are closer to a dynamic failure so as to improve their chances of meeting their deadlines. The paper proposes a heuristic for assigning these priorities. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated through simulation under various customer arrival and service patterns. The scheme is compared to a conventional scheme where all customers are serviced at the same priority level and to an imprecise computation model approach. The evaluation shows that substantial reductions in the probability of dynamic failure are achieved when the proposed policy is used.",

It is shown how different types of timing requirements might be expressed and enforced in Flex, how they might be fulfilled in a flexible way using different program models, and how the programming environment can help in making binding and scheduling decisions. The timing constraint primitives in Flex are easy to use yet powerful enough to define both independent and relative timing constraints. Program models like imprecise computation and performance polymorphism can carry out flexible real-time programs. In addition, programmers can use a performance measurement tool that produces statistically correct timing models to predict the expected execution time of a program and to help make binding decisions. A real-time programming environment is also presented.",

Each service supported on the (wide area, broadband) ATM network is characterized by a rate or bandwidth requirement. Future networks will be characterized by links with very large capacities in circuits and by many rates. Various asymptotic results are given to reduce the attendant complexity of numerical calculations. A central element is a uniform asymptotic approximation (UAA) for link analyses. Moreover, a unified hybrid approach is given which allows asymptotic and nonasymptotic methods of calculations to be used cooperatively. Network loss probabilities are obtained by solving fixed-point equations. A canonical problem of route and logical network design is considered. An optimization procedure is proposed, which is guided by gradients obtained by solving a system of equations for implied costs. A novel application of the EM algorithm gives an efficient technique for calculating implied costs with changing traffic conditions. Finally, we report numerical results obtained by the software package TALISMAN, which incorporates the theoretical results. The network considered has eight nodes, 20 links, six services, and as many as 160 routes.",

            "abstract" : "A growing class of real-time systems require end-to-end support for various quality-of-service (QoS) aspects, including bandwidth, latency, jitter and dependability. Applications include command and control, manufacturing process control, videoconferencing, large-scale distributed interactive simulation, and testbeam data acquisition. These systems require support for stringent QoS requirements. To meet this challenge, developers are turning to distributed object computing middleware, such as the Common Object Request Broker Architecture, an Object Management Group (OMG) industry standard. In complex real-time systems, DOC middleware resides between applications and the underlying operating systems, protocol stacks and hardware. CORBA helps decrease the cycle time and effort required to develop high-quality systems by composing applications using reusable software component services rather than building them entirely from scratch. The Real-Time CORBA specification includes features to manage CPU, network and memory resources. The authors describe the key Real-Time CORBA features that they feel are the most relevant to researchers and developers of distributed real-time and embedded systems.",

The control system is described using a number of connected continuous-time and discrete-time linear systems driven by white noise. The control performance is measured by a continuous-time quadratic cost function. A stochastic timing model is used to describe when the different discrete-time systems are updated during the control period. Building different models, the tool makes it easy to investigate how the control performance is affected by e.g. delay, jitter, lost samples, aborted computations, and jitter compensation. Aperiodic and multi-rate controllers may also be studied. The tool is also capable of computing the spectral densities of the different signals in the system.",

We are particularly interested in controllers where the execution time may change abruptly between different modes, such as in hybrid controllers. The proposed solution attempts to keep the CPU utilization at a high level, avoid overload, and distribute the computing resources evenly among the tasks. The feedback scheduler is implemented as a periodic or sporadic task that assigns sampling periods to the controllers based on execution-time measurements. The controllers may also communicate feedforward mode-change information to the scheduler. As an example, we consider hybrid control of a set of double-tank processes. The system is evaluated, from both scheduling and control performance perspectives, by co-simulation of controllers, scheduler and tanks.",

The method can achieve clock synchronization precisions superior to those attainable by previously published clock synchronization algorithms. The method can be used to improve the precision of both internal and external synchronization algorithms. The approach is probabilistic because it does not guarantee that a processor can always read a remote clock with an a priori specified precision; however, by retrying a sufficient number of times, a process can read the clock of another process with a given precision with a probability as close to one as desired. An important characteristic of the method is that, when a process succeeds in reading a remote clock, it knows the actual reading precision achieved. The use of the remote clock reading methods is illustrated by presenting a time service which maintains externally (and, hence, internally) synchronized clocks in the presence of process, communication, and clock failures.",

Depending on the types and number of tolerated faults, this paper presents upper bounds on the achievable synchronization accuracy for external and internal synchronization in a distributed real-time system. The concept of continuous versus instantaneous synchronization is introduced in order to generate a uniform common time base for local, global, and external time measurements. In the last section, the functions of a VLSI clock synchronization unit, which improves the synchronization accuracy and reduces the CPU load, are described. With this unit, the CPU overhead and the network traffic for clock synchronization in state-of-the-art distributed real-time systems can be reduced to less than 1 percent.",

Each equation in the set characterizes the diffusion of phase (time) and frequency generated at each network node. The matrices of this model define the topological structure of the network. The time-frequency model is used to characterize the timefrequency stability of the network clock ensemble. Expressions for the steady-state network frequency and the time differences between nodal clocks are derived and compared for plesiochronous, delay compensated and uncompensated networks. A network frequency stability measure is introduced, evaluated and performance comparisons are made for specific network configurations.

            "abstract" : "The paper contains a proposal and an analysis of a hybrid method for synchronizing the clocks in a digital switching network to a more select group of master clocks. The scheme is a hybrid of two well-known techniques, mutual synchronization and masterslave, offering certain unique advantages. It allows different synchronizing disciplines for the masters (such as the toll switching machines) and the remaining subnetwork (composed, for example, of local switches). We begin by considering an idealized model containing only one master with constant clock frequency. The behavior of the controlled frequencies in the subnetwork is described by linear delay-differential equations with the delays determined by distances separating switches. We show that in all cases all clocks in the subnetwork approach in steady state the master clock frequency. Considerable emphasis is placed on the rate of synchronization, as determined by the principal root, the root with largest real part, of the characteristic function of the differential equations. The idealized model is extended in stages. First we consider the effects of many masters with constant but possibly nonidentical frequencies and show that the steady state frequencies in the subnetwork are narrowly bounded. Next, we allow clock drift and the master clocks to fluctuate about nominal centers with given tolerances. An expression for the residual steady-state departures from perfect synchronization shows the tradeoff between transient and stead-state behavior. Finally, two illustrative examples are numerically solved.",

            "abstract" : "The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is widely deployed in the Internet to synchronize computer clocks to each other and to international standards via telephone modem, radio and satellite. The protocols and algorithms have evolved over more than a decade to produce the present NTP Version 3 specification and implementations. Most of the estimated deployment of 100000 NTP servers and clients enjoy synchronization to within a few tens of milliseconds in the Internet of today. This paper describes specific improvements developed for NTP Version 3 which have resulted in increased accuracy, stability and reliability in both local-area and wide-area networks. These include engineered refinements of several algorithms used to measure time differences between a local clock and a number of peer clocks in the network, as well as to select the best subset from among an ensemble of peer clocks and combine their differences to produce a local dock accuracy better than any in the ensemble. This paper also describes engineered refinements of the algorithms used to adjust the time and frequency of the local clock, which functions as a disciplined oscillator. The refinements provide automatic adjustment of algorithm parameters in response to prevailing network conditions, in order to minimize network traffic between clients and busy servers while maintaining the best accuracy. Finally, this paper describes certain enhancements to the Unix operating system kernel software in order to realize submillisecond accuracies with fast workstations and networks.",

The algorithm is intended for the network time protocol (NTP), which is in widespread use to synchronize computer clocks in the global Internet, or with another functionally equivalent protocol such as DTSS or PCS. It controls the computer clock time and frequency using an adaptive-parameter hybrid phase/frequency lock feedback loop. Compared with the current NTP Version 3 algorithm, the new algorithm developed for NTP Version 4 provides improved accuracy and reduced network overhead, especially when per-packet or per-call charges are involved. The algorithm has been implemented in a special-purpose NTP simulator, which also includes the entire suite of NTP algorithms. The performance has been verified using this simulator and both synthetic data and real data from Internet time servers in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.",

The event was caused by a tornado collapsing a quad built tower, resulting in simultaneous faults on two 345 kV lines and two 138 kV lines. Various means of combining relaying messages were examined to potentially reduce the traffic. The issue of message simultaneity was simulated to determine its effect on potential message collisions and LAN performance. The performance of 10 and 100 MB shared and switched hub LANs was simulated at various message levels. The performance requirement was to deliver messages, application to application, in 4 milliseconds. The simulations showed that a 10 MB shared hub LAN met the requirement up to 15 messages.

Finally, a technique for the elimination of redundant synchronization instructions is presented.",

The program representation and the transformations are applicable to both structured and unstructured programs, making region scheduling useful for a wide range of applications.

The first compiler optimization considered is cycle shrinking which can be used to parallelize certain types of serial loops. A run-time dependence analysis is then considered along with how it can be performed through compiler-inserted bookkeeping and control statements. Loops with unstructured parallelism, that cannot benefit from existing optimizations, can be parallelized through run-time dependence checking. Finally, barrier synchronization is discussed as one of the most serious sources of run-time overhead in parallel programs. To reduce the impact of barriers, the author briefly discusses the implementation of distributed barriers through the use of a set of shared registers.",

A practical method is given by which one can check whether or not a statement is dependent upon another. The dependence structure of the whole loop may be of different types. For each type, a set of time and processor upper bounds is given. We also show how a loop can sometimes be transformed to change its dependence structure. Finally, we give a result on the possible splitting up of a given recurrence system into a number of smaller subsystems. These results can be used to modify and sometimes improve the bounds for the loops as demanded by special circumstances.",

The algorithm can be used to enhance the effectiveness of vectorizers, parallelizers, and programming environments. The method performs loop distribution in the presence of control flow based on control dependencies.

Dependences constrain the parallel execution of programs and are typically enforced by synchronization instructions. The synchronization instructions represent a significant part of the overhead in the parallel execution of a program. Some program dependences are redundant because they are covered by other dependences. It is shown that unlike with single loops, in the case of nested loops, a particular dependence may be redundant at some iterations but not redundant at others, so that the redundancy of a dependence may not be uniform over the entire iteration space. A sufficient condition for the uniformity of redundancy in a doubly nested loop is developed.",

We discuss this subject in general terms, including automation of these transformations, and present a number of such transforms. This is followed by experimental results which indicate that these transformations are indeed effective. Use of practical, simple memory management policies like the fixed allocation local lru replacement algorithm leads to average improvements over untransformed programs of a factor of 10 in space-time cost, and a factor of 5 in memory size. Multiprogramming questions are also discussed.",

In general, however, hardware lookahead window is too small to exploit instruction-level parallelism at run time, while compaction-based parallelizing compilers must suffer from worst-case exponential code explosion at compile time. In this paper, the authors propose a software lookahead method, which allows inter-basic block code motions within the prespecified number of operations, called software lookahead window, on any path emanating from the currently processed instruction at compile time. By software lookahead, instruction-level parallelism can be exploited in a much greater code area than the hardware approach, but the lookahead region is still limited to a constant depth with a user-specifiable window, and thus code explosion is restricted. The proposed scheme has been implemented in the authors prototype parallelizing compiler, which can generate code for uniprocessors with multiple functional units and multiway conditional branches, such as VLIW machines, and potentially for super-scalars as well.",

The state of the art in data dependence analysis and some parallel execution techniques are examined. The major findings are included. Many subscripts contain symbolic terms with unknown values. A few methods of determining their values at compile time are evaluated. Array references with coupled subscripts appear quite frequently; these subscripts must be handled simultaneously in a dependence test, rather than being handled separately as in current test algorithms. Nonzero coefficients of loop indexes in most subscripts are found to be simple: they are either 1 or -1. This allows an exact real-valued test to be as accurate as an exact integer-valued test for one-dimensional or two-dimensional arrays. Dependencies with uncertain distance are found to be rather common, and one of the main reasons is the frequent appearance of symbolic terms with unknown values.",

Requirements modeling is what systems engineers and systems analysts do with Rosetta SLDL. Rosetta SLDL is information technology that supports the specification of multi-technology, multifaceted, multi-discipline systems. Until the Rosetta SLDL emerged, no good way existed to help the design team get its arms around all of the requirements for a complex system. Requirements related issues are the most common source of systems engineering problems and they impact all aspects of product development. Requirements models help design teams stay on the same page with each other. Requirements modeling reduces cycle time, reduces costs, reduces the probability of overruns, and helps with support and sustainment of the product. Requirements models will be the input to many new and enhanced design automation tools and processes. The benefits of requirements modeling technology are wide reaching, because system requirements touch everything and everyone associated with a product.",

The CSDF paradigm is an extension of synchronous dataflow that still allows for static scheduling and, thus, a very efficient implementation of an application. In comparison with synchronous dataflow, it is more versatile because it also supports algorithms with a cyclically changing, but predefined, behavior. Our examples show that this capability results in a higher degree of parallelism and, hence, a higher throughput, shorter delays, and less buffer memory. Moreover, they indicate that CSDF is essential for modelling prescheduled components, like application-specific integrated circuits. Besides introducing the CSDF paradigm, we also derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the schedulability of a CSDF graph. We present and compare two methods for checking the liveness of a graph. The first one checks the liveness of loops, and the second one constructs a single-processor schedule for one iteration of the graph. Once the schedulability is tested, a makespan optimal schedule on a multiprocessor can be constructed. We also introduce the heuristic scheduling method of our graphical rapid prototyping environment (GRAPE).",

When dataflow graphs are placed in a control context, the graph execution is fully controllable; its execution can be restarted or suspended and parameters can be changed.

Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the existence of a bounded cyclic schedule as well as sufficient conditions for execution of the graph in bounded memory. The techniques presented apply to a more general class of dataflow graphs than previous methods.",

In Moses, visual language syntax is defined by first-order predicates over the abstract syntax of a picture, represented by an attributed graph. One way of specifying language semantics in Moses is by writing an abstract state machine that interprets a given attributed graph. This paper shows how the editor is parameterized with a description of a visual language, and discusses briefly the generic architecture used to animate and debug visual programs.",

            "abstract" : "Many signal processing systems make use of event driven mechanisms-typically based on finite state machines (FSMs)-to control the operation of the computationally intensive (data flow) parts. The state machines in turn are often fueled by external inputs as well as by feedback from the signal processing portions of the system. Packet-based transmission systems are a good example for such a close interaction between data and control flow. For a smooth design flow with a maximum degree of modularity it is of crucial importance to be able to model the complete functionality of the system, containing both control and data flow, within one single design environment. While the degree of abstraction should be sufficiently high to model and simulate efficiently, the link to implementation has to be fully supported. For these reasons we developed a computational model that integrates the specification of control and data flow. It combines the notion of multirate dynamic data flow graphs with event driven process activation. Thus, it maintains the flexibility and expressive power of data flow representations while enabling designers to efficiently control these operations by incorporating control automata that may have been designed using protocol compilers or state machine tools.",

The language is intended to be, at the same time, an executable simulation language, and a specification of a virtual machine implementing the algorithm. The language is semantically sound, and is suitable to perform program transforms-a major requirement when the ultimate goal is an aid to the architecture design.",

Data flow programs for signal processing are directed graphs where each node represents a function and each arc represents a signal path. Synchronous data flow (SDF) is a special case of data flow (either atomic or large grain) in which the number of data samples produced or consumed by each node on each invocation is specified a priori. Nodes can be scheduled statically (at compile time) onto single or parallel programmable processors so the run-time overhead usually associated with data flow evaporates. Multiple sample rates within the same system are easily and naturally handled. Conditions for correctness of SDF graph are explained and scheduling algorithms are described for homogeneous parallel processors sharing memory. A preliminary SDF software system for automatically generating assembly language code for DSP microcomputers is described. Two new efficiency techniques are introduced, static buffering and an extension to SDF to efficiently implement conditionals.",

            "abstract" : "We review a model of computation used in industrial practice in signal processing software environments and experimentally and other contexts. We give this model the name dataflow process networks, and study its formal properties as well as its utility as a basis for programming language design. Variants of this model are used in commercial visual programming systems such as SPW from the Alta Group of Cadence (formerly Comdisco Systems), COSSAP from Synopsys (formerly Cadis), the DSP Station from Mentor Graphics, and Hypersignal from Hyperception. They are also used in research software such as Khoros from the University of New Mexico and Ptolemy from the University of California at Berkeley, among many others. Dataflow process networks are shown to be a special case of Kahn process networks, a model of computation where a number of concurrent processes communicate through unidirectional FIFO channels, where writes to the channel are nonblocking, and reads are blocking. In dataflow process networks, each process consists of repeated firings of a dataflow actor. An actor defines a (often functional) quantum of computation. By dividing processes into actor firings, the considerable overhead of context switching incurred in most implementations of Kahn process networks is avoided. We relate dataflow process networks to other dataflow models, including those used in dataflow machines, such as static dataflow and the tagged-token model. We also relate dataflow process networks to functional languages such as Haskell, and show that modern language concepts such as higher-order functions and polymorphism can be used effectively in dataflow process networks. A number of programming examples using a visual syntax are given.",

The primary objective of the case study is the validation of the SPADE methodology for architecture exploration. The case study demonstrates that this methodology provides a structured approach to the efficient evaluation of the performance of candidate architectures for selected benchmark applications. We learned that the MPEG-2 decoder can conveniently be modeled as a Kahn process network using a simple API. Abstract models of architectures can be constructed efficiently using a library of generic building blocks. A trace driven simulation technique enables the use of these abstract models for performance analysis with correct handling of data dependent behavior. We performed a design space exploration to derive how the performance of the decoder depends on the busload and the frame rate.",

            "abstract" : "Large grain data flow (LGDF) programming is natural and convenient for describing digital signal processing (DSP) systems, but its runtime overhead is costly in real time or cost-sensitive applications. In some situations, designers are not willing to squander computing resources for the sake of programmer convenience. This is particularly true when the target machine is a programmable DSP chip. However, the runtime overhead inherent in most LGDF implementations is not required for most signal processing systems because such systems are mostly synchronous (in the DSP sense). Synchronous data flow (SDF) differs from traditional data flow in that the amount of data produced and consumed by a data flow node is specified a priori for each input and output. This is equivalent to specifying the relative sample rates in signal processing system. This means that the scheduling of SDF nodes need not be done at runtime, but can be done at compile time (statically), so the runtime overhead evaporates. The sample rates can all be different, which is not true of most current data-driven digital signal processing programming methodologies. Synchronous data flow is closely related to computation graphs, a special case of Petri nets. This self-contained paper develops the theory necessary to statically schedule SDF programs on single or multiple processors. A class of static (compile time) scheduling algorithms is proven valid, and specific algorithms are given for scheduling SDF systems onto single or multiple processors.",

            "abstract" : "Analytical properties of programming languages with dataflow graph semantics are discussed. It is shown that one of the most serious problems with these languages is that subtle inconsistencies between parts of the dataflow graph can be inadvertently created. These inconsistencies can lead to deadlock, or in the case of nonterminating programs, to unbounded memory requirements. Consistency is defined to mean that the same number of tokens is consumed as produced on any arc, in the long run. A token-flow model is developed for testing for inconsistency. The method is a generalization of consistency checks for synchronous dataflow (SDF) graphs. The token-flow model is compared to similar tests applied to hybrid dynamical systems. It is argued that dataflow semantics make steady-state analysis possible, leading to a simpler method in most cases.",

Markov models are presented as a generalization of their predecessor technology, dynamic programming. A unified view is offered in which both linguistic decoding and acoustic matching are integrated into a single, optimal network search framework. Advances in recognition architectures are discussed. The fundamentals of Viterbi beam search, the dominant search algorithm used today in speed recognition, are presented. Approaches to estimating the probabilities associated with an HMM model are examined. The HMM-supervised training paradigm is examined. Several examples of successful HMM-based speech recognition systems are reviewed.",

The Actor model unifies objects and concurrency. Actors are autonomous, distributed, concurrently executing objects that can send each other messages asynchronously. The Actor models communication abstractions and object-oriented design are discussed. Three mechanisms for developing modular and reusable components for concurrent systems are also discussed. The mechanism are synchronizers, modular specifications of resource management policies, and protocol customization of dependability.",

The key is to use visual domain specific models. Because there are many different domains, it is economical to develop a generic and configurable visual programming environment (VPE) that can be customized for the domains and paradigms. The author discusses a generic VPEs requirements, design, and implementation, and illustrates its use in a system, the Intelligent Process-Control System (IPCS), for the process control domain. This VPE and the IPCS have been developed in a multiyear research effort. Different versions of the VPE are used at many companies, including Boeing, DuPont, and NASA, and the IPCS has been commercialized by the Osaka Gas Information Systems Research Institute (Osaka, Japan).",

It forms the basis of a programming model that uses domain-specific elemental units to provide specific, yet flexible, guidelines to control engineers for creating and integrating software components. We use a port-based object abstraction, based on combining the notion of an object with the port-automaton algebraic model of concurrent processes. It is supported by an implementation using domain-specific communication mechanisms and templates that have been incorporated into the Chimera real-time operating system and applied to several robotic applications. This paper describes the port-based object abstraction, provides a detailed analysis of communication and synchronization based on distributed shared memory, and describes a programming paradigm based on a framework process and code templates for quickly implementing applications.",

Compositionality refers to the ability of freely composing hybrid systems. This amounts to relying on a behavioral approach. Since hybrid systems are considered, different time indices occur, and modularity calls for considering time as local to each module, this is what we call multiform time. Our framework is behavioral, and we discuss its relations with the more traditional state based point of view.",

            "abstract" : "The logic and synchronization characteristics of general dynamical systems called hybrid dynamical systems (HDS) are studied. The theory is related to discrete event dynamical system theory, but handles numerics as well as symbolics. It is supported by the programming language Signal and a mathematical model of general implicit dynamical systems. The core of the theory is the notion of HDS resolution which is based on a coding of any HDS into a dynamic graph which consists of a skew product of a polynomial dynamical system on the finite field of integers modulo 3 (to describe the transitions of the underlying automation) and directed graphs (to describe how data dependencies dynamically evolve). The resolution algorithms are based on the study of this dynamical system.",

Configurations discussed involve interrogation and reply between a user and a single donor, and one-way propagation between a user and the multiple sites of a reference system. The latter category includes navigation systems, which are shown to be appropriate means for disseminating time. Further ramifications of time dissemination are discussed, including the characteristics of clocks suitable for airborne application. Variables and their relationship and solution are defined for stationary and moving users, and for users of atomic and crystal clocks. For the case in which frequency is offset between clocks, as is likely when crystal oscillators are used, methods are described that permit the estimate of offset in frequency as well as in time. Recursive minimum-variance methods are examined in some detail, and a parametric analysis of performance relative to random and systematic sources of error is given.",

Such clocks can provide a decentralized definition of time for distributed computing systems, which lack a common time base. In their full generality, partially ordered logical clocks may be impractically expensive for long-lived computations.

            "abstract" : "Causality is vital in distributed computations. Distributed systems can determine causality using logical clocks. Human beings use the concept of causality to plan, schedule, and execute an enterprise, or to determine a plans feasibility. In daily life, we use global time to deduce causality from loosely synchronized clocks such as wrist watches and wall clocks. But in distributed computing systems, the rate of event occurrence is several magnitudes higher, and the event-execution time several magnitudes smaller. If the physical clocks in these systems are not synchronized precisely the causality relation between events cannot be captured accurately. However, distributed systems have no built-in physical time and can only approximate it. This article presents a general framework of a system of logical clocks in distributed systems and discusses three methods: scalar, vector and matrix, for implementing logical time in these systems.",

This realization requires no multiplications, and exploits the relative simplicity of delta modulation as a means for analog to digital conversion.

An evaluation of this realization in terms of computation time storage requirements and mean-squared error is presented. These characteristics are compared with their counterparts for existing realization methods of nonrecursive digital filters.

            "abstract" : "This paper contains a description of the architecture of the fast digital processor (FDP), a general purpose digital attachment to a UNIVAC 1219 computer facility. The main purpose of the FDP is to enhance the capability of the UNIVAC facility for performance of digital signal processing operations such as digital filtering and discrete Fourier transforms. The structural design evolved during a series of discussions among the four authors. The FDP is presently being constructed under the supervision of one of the authors, P. McHugh, and should be completed in late 1970.",

            "abstract" : "It is shown how the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) can be used to convert a one-dimensional cyclic convolution to a multi-dimensional convolution which is cyclic in all dimensions. Then, special algorithms are developed which, compute the relatively short convolutions in each of the dimensions. The original suggestion for this procedure was made in order to extend the lengths of the convolutions which one can compute with number-theoretic transforms. However, it is shown that the method can be more efficient, for some data sequence lengths, than the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. Some of the short convolutions are computed by methods in an earlier paper by Agarwal and Burrus. Recent work of Winograd, consisting of theorems giving the minimum possible numbers of multiplications and methods for achieving them, are applied to these short convolutions.",

            "abstract" : "Microprocessors have achieved great popularity because they are inexpensive, convenient, and flexible. A microprocessor with an architecture chosen to efficiently perform digital signal processing algorithms would retain these advantages when used to implement digital signal processing. One such architecture is the Research Signal Processor (RSP) which was designed by Abraham Peled and constructed at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. In order for the RSP to be cost effective, however, it must be capable of implementing a wide range of problems so that the cost of developing an LSI version can be borne by many applications. The potential applications, however, vary greatly in size. A microprocessor capable of implementing the largest of these applications would be expensive and underutilized for many others. The approach we have chosen is to implement modestly sized applications with a single RSP, and to distribute larger applications over several RSPs. In the hope of keeping the cost of this distribution small, two simple structures, the parallel and cascade clusters were first investigated. This paper presents the attributes of these structures when used to implement the FFT, FIR filters and IIR filters. The types of data transfers required to implement these algorithms are also found, and the I/O capabilities of the RSP chosen to perform these transfers are presented.",

This paper contributes to the design methodology of efficient VLSI algorithms. We present a transformation that converts synchronous systems into more time-efficient, systolic implementations by removing combinational rippling. The problem of determining the optimized system can be reduced to the graph-theoretic single-destination-shortest-paths problem. More importantly from an engineering standpoint, however, the kinds of rippling that can be removed from a circuit at essentially no cost can be easily characterized. For example, if the only global communication in a system is broadcasting from the host computer, the broadcast can always be replaced by local communication.",

            "abstract" : "An adaptive predictive coding with adaptive bit allocation (APC-AB) is presented for speech encoding at low to medium bit rates (6.4kb/s-24kb/s). In this system, a split-band predictive coding scheme and a bit allocation scheme are employed in order to remove the redundancies due to a periodic concentration of the prediction residual energy as well as nonuniform nature of the speech spectrum. Quantization bits are dynamically allocated both over the sub-bands(frequency domain) and over the subintervals(time domain) in accordance with the distribution of the residual energies in the time-frequency domain. Optimum bit allocation is derived based on the mean square error criterion on the speech waveform, and the SNR gain is presented in relation to the prediction gain of the full-band signal. This system is evaluated in terms of the segmental SNR and speech quality. The result shows that the APC-AB system has advantage over the conventional full-band APC system in the segmental SNR and the stability of the prediction loop. It was also shown that this system can provide speech quality subjectively equivalent to 7 bit Log-PCM at 16 kb/s, and to 6 bit Log-PCM at 9.6 kb/s.",

As the loop is unrolled by more times, we will get large bigger codes that we need the hardware resource sharply increased. To solve the problem which needs large hardware resource because of unrolling the loop, we propose a new approach which is reconstructing state to share state resource and establishing the finite state machine model of software pipelining. It is the cost-efficiency code generation approach of software pipelining. The model can fulfill to reuse hardware resource and need less hardware resource by using the FSM to control the reusing of kernel codes of the pipelining technology.",

            "abstract" : "Two addition and three multiplication algorithms were studied to see the effect of pipelining on system efficiency. A definition of efficiency was derived to compare the relative merits of various algorithms and implementations for addition and multiplication. This definition is basically defined as bandwidth cost. Previous comparisons of adders and multipliers have generally been based on latency. In a pipeline environment, latency (or its inverse bandwidth) is not as important. Any bandwidth is possible up to the physical limitations on gate delay variations and pulse skew. The formal definition for efficiency is efficiency = N/DG where N is the number of bits in the operands, D is the delay (uniform) of each pipeline stage in units of gate delays, and G is the total number of gates, including any used for latching. In cases where gate variations and pulse skewing are well defined, pipelining using the Earle latch results in increased efficiency. The most efficient adder is a maximally pipelined conditional-sum adder (three stages with a delay of four gates per stage). Its efficiency is 6.3010<sup>-3</sup>. The most efficient multiplier is a maximally pipelined tree multiplier (eight stages with a delay of four gates per stage). Its efficiency is 3.4810<sup>-4</sup>.",

This class includes such notoriously difficult problems as the traveling salesman problem, graph coloring, and satisfiability of Boolean expressions. This paper describes some problems in digital signal processing which are NP-complete. These include: (1) Minimize the number of registers required to implement a signal flow graph; (2) Minimize the time to perform the additions (multiplications) of a signal flow graph using P adders (multipliers); (3) Minimize the computational cost for multiplication by a fixed matrix.

The results show that significant reductions in AP-product (reciprocal of throughput per unit area) can be achieved by-intermediate latching in many typical signal processing applications, for a wide range of circuit parameters.",

For the new trend it will be a necessity to have revolutionary architectural design concepts such as topological mapping between algorithm and architecture, simple and regular data flow etc [1]. In this paper, based on a natural topology of the computing structure, a novel computational wave-front notion is introduced for describing and and validating data flow in locally connected networks. The parallel architectures include the linear system, with and without pivoting, and the least-square solver using Givens method. We believe that this set of linear system architectures will play a central role in modern signal processing.",

Given a rectangular circuit component on a planar surface with terminals around its boundary, the algorithm finds an optimal set of paths in the plane connecting specified pairs of terminals. The paths are restricted to lie on the outside of the component and must consist of line segments orthogonal to the sides of the component. Paths may intersect at a point but may not overlap. The criterion for optimality is the area of a rectangle with sides orthogonal to those of the component which circumscribes the component and paths. The algorithm has running time O(t3), where t is the number of terminals on the component.",

            "abstract" : "Real-time Linux variants are becoming prominent solutions for the development of embedded systems. Compared to traditional real-time operating systems, embedded system engineers can leverage solutions and knowhow from the Linux development community (e.g., development tools, applications, drivers). Due to the availability of implementations of Internet protocols and network drivers, Linux also facilitates the implementation of embedded systems connected to the Internet. The goal of this paper is to evaluate experimentally the capabilities of the Real-time Linux variant RTAI/LXRT with respect to partitioning between different application software modules. Partitioning ensures that a failure caused by a design fault in one application software module cannot propagate to cause a failure in other application software modules, e.g., by blocking access to the CPU or by overwriting memory. Partitioning is important when building mixed-criticality systems comprising both non safety-critical software modules and safety-related ones. Even at the same level of criticality, partitioning improves the robustness of an embedded system. The experimental results described in this paper point out several limitations of RTAI/LXRT Linux concerning fault isolation. Based on these results, we propose modifications to improve the partitioning with respect to temporal and spatial interference.",

            "abstract" : "This paper describes the organization of a multi-module memory, designed to facilitate parallel block transfers. All modules are assumed to be identical, and the individual modules can fetch or store no more than one word or word group during any single memory cycle. Parallel block transfers are made possible in multimodule memories by utilizing a device called the memory circulator and by organizing the memory in a particular way. The memory circulator consists of a bank of interconnected registers, one for each memory, and control circuitry. The memory system is organized so that ascending logical addresses are distributed cyclically among the modules. If there are 2<sup>b</sup> modules, then any individual word is accessed by using the least significant b bits of a memory address to select a module and by using the remaining bits to select an address within a module. The memory circulator can load and store a contiguous block of 2<sup>b</sup> words by selecting all modules and broadcasting a single address to all modules. A contiguous block can be displaced in memory by a multiple of 2<sup>b</sup> words by broadcasting different load and store addresses for a block of data. The circulator control circuitry includes a masking capability so that blocks smaller than 2<sup>b</sup> can be moved in this fashion. When the displacement of a block transfer is not a multiple of 2<sup>b</sup> a physical circulation of the data in the memory circulator registers is required.",

            "abstract" : "Under service-oriented architecture (SOA), servers (service providers) provide services to clients as well as other orchestrators, i.e. they are parts of several orchestrations. Due to different types of interaction, servers may have to operate concurrently under several policies. Moreover, when interacting with clients or peer servers, a server may be subject to global constraints determined by system authorities, e.g. system administrator. In this paper, we present a framework to enforce multiple policies on server behavior with emphasis on server activities in orchestration. Our framework employs LGI-based middleware, and does not require any change of the conventional SOAP-based protocol, the UDDI server, the programs of servers and clients, or the BPEL engine employed by service orchestrators.",

In spite of the generality of the definition of complexity one may obtain the following inequality which gives upper and lower bounds on this maximum complexity: C<sub>1</sub>2<sup>r</sup>/r&#x02266;E(p, q)&#x02266;C<sub>2</sub>2<sup>r</sup>/r where r = p+log<sub>2</sub> q.

The architecture or hard-ware structure of the Illiac IV is discussed--the Illiac IV array is an array processor with a specialized control unit (CU) that can be viewed as a small stand-alone computer. The Illiac IV software strategy is described in terms of current user habits and needs. Brief descriptions are given of the systems software itself, its history, and the major lessons learned during its development. Some ideas for future development are suggested. Applications of Illiac IV are discussed in terms of evaluating the function f(x) simultaneously on up to 64 distinct argument sets x<inf>i</inf>. Many of the time-consuming problems in scientific computation involve repeated evaluation of the same function on different argument sots. The argument sets which compose the problem data base must be structured in such a fashion that they can be distributed among 64 separate memories. Two matrix applications: Jacobis algorithm for finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real symmetric matrices, and reducing a real nonsymmetric matrix to the upper-Hessenberg form using Householders transformations are discussed in detail. The ARPA network, a highly sophisticated and wide ranging experiment in the remote access and sharing of computer resources, is briefly described and its current status discussed. Many researchers located about the country who will use Illiac IV in solving problems will do so via the network. The various systems, hardware, and procedures they will use is discussed.",

The Pluribus system places the major responsibility for recovery from failures on the software. Failing hardware modules are removed from the system, spare modules are substituted where available, and appropriate initialization is performed. In applications where the goal is maximum availability rather than totally fault-free operation, this approach represents a considerable savings in complexity and cost over traditional implementations. The software-based reliability approach has been extended to provide enror-handling and recovery mechanisms for the system software structures as well. A number of Pluribus systems have been built and are currently in operation. Experience with these systems has given us confidence in their performance and maintainability, and leads us to suggest other applications that might benefit from this approach.",

Time bounds, speed-up and efficiency for SIMD and MIMD computers with fixed number of arithmetic elements (AEs), as well as for pipelined computers with fixed number of stages per operation, are obtained.

Scheduling of such tasks can be done statistically. Further, scheduling algorithms operating under such conditions are usually limited to multiprocessor configurations. The authors present a scheduling algorithm which works dynamically and on loosely coupled distributed systems for tasks with hard real-time constraints; i.e., the tasks must meet their deadlines. It uses a scheduling component local to every node and a distributed scheduling scheme which is specifically suited to hard real-time constraints and other timing considerations. Periodic tasks, nonperiodic tasks, scheduling overheads, communication overheads due to scheduling and preemption are all accounted for in the algorithm. Simulation studies are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.",

However, sometimes it is desirable to provide different classes or levels of service in order to satisfy the needs of different users and applications. In this paper, we propose an architecture for the provision of differentiated services at the Web server level. The architecture is verified by means of a simulation model and real Web server traces are used as workload. Two priority-based algorithms are implemented in the architecture aiming at service differentiation. The adaptive algorithm, an innovative solution at the application domain, allows the tuning of the priority level provided and determines how strict the use of priorities would be. The system can then adapt itself to various workloads, an essential feature in a highly dynamic environment such as the Web.",

Site backup is the problem of creating a static backup copy of a database for archival or query purposes. We present an algorithm that solves the site initialization problem. By modifying the algorithm slightly, we get solutions to the other two problems as well. Our algorithm exploits the fact that a correct DDBS must run a serializable concurrency control algorithm. Our algorithm relies on the concurrency control algorithm to handle all intersite synchronization.",

Most of the previous work in this area has assumed that once a transaction acquires a particular kind of lock on a data item it is not allowed to convert this lock to another kind. In this paper we perform a systematic study of the consequences of allowing lock conversions in non-two-phase locking protocols, and show how this leads to increased concurrency and affects deadlock-freedom. The non-two-phase protocols that we study are the very general guard protocols defined for databases in which a directed acyclic graph structure can be superimposed on the data items. We present very natural generalizations of these protocols, including correctness proofs, and develop deadlock removal methods.",

When computers are in control of time-critical systems such as aircraft, nuclear reactors, and life-support systems, they must meet stringent performance requirements. However, these requirements cannot be properly stated without appropriate performance measures. We review and analyze such measures in this paper.",

The paper addresses the problem of identification and optimal control of stochastic tool path error in a thin rib machining process, both analytically and experimentally. Tool path error, in numerically controlled machines, consists of both deterministic and stochastic components and is defined as the vector difference between the programmed path and the actual path taken by the tool relative to the workpiece. A methodology is developed to identify the cutting process parameters based on experimental data from the thin rib machining of microwave guides. An LQG optimal controller was designed to minimise the stochastic tool path error. The results of optimal controller simulation are discussed. The microprocessor- based online optimal controller was validated, on a small computer numerically controlled (CNC) milling machine, to demonstrate improved performance in the thin rib machining of microwave guides.",

User-visible performance of the total system (SIFT plus its environment) is modeled as a random variable taking values in a set of accomplishment levels. These levels are defined in terms of four attributes of total system behavior: safety, no change in mission profile, no operational penalties, and no economic penalties. The base model of the total system is a stochastic process whose states describe the internal structure of SIFT as well as relevant conditions of its environment. Base model state trajectories are related to accomplishment levels via a capability function which is formulated in terms of a three-level model hierarchy. Solution methods are then applied to determine the performability of the total system for various choices of computer and environment parameter values.",

            "abstract" : "The classical reliability model for N-modular redundancy (NMR) assumes the network to be failed when a majority of modules which drive the same voter fail. It has long been known that this model is pessimistic since there are instances, termed compensating module failures, where a majority of the modules fail but the network is nonfailed. A different module reliability model based on lead reliability is proposed which has the classical NMR reliability model as a special case. Recent results from the area of test generation are employed to simplify the module reliability calculation under the lead reliability model. First a fault equivalent technique, based on functional equivalence of faults, is developed to determine the effect of compensating module failures on system reliability. This technique can increase the predicted mission time (the time the system is to operate at or above a given reliability) by at least 40 percent over the classical model prediction for simple networks. Since the fault equivalent technique is too complex for modeling of large circuits a second, computational simpler technique, based on fault dominance, is derived. It is then shown to yield results comparable to the fault equivalent technique. A more complex example circuit analyzed by the fault dominance model shows at least a 75 percent improvement in mission time due to modeling compensating module failures. A commercialy available 31 gate integrated circuit chip is also modeled to demonstrate the applicability of the technique to large circuits.",

            "abstract" : "FTMP is a digital computer architecture which has evolved over a ten-year period in connection with several life-critical aerospace applications. Most recently it has been proposed as a fault-tolerant central computer for civil transport aircraft applications. A working emulation has been operating for some time, and the first engineering prototype is scheduled to be completed in late 1979. FTMP is designed to have a failure rate due to random causes of the order of 10<sup>-10</sup>failures per hour, on ten-hour flights where no air-borne maintenance is available. The prefered maintenance interval is of the order of hundreds of flight hours, and the probability that maintenance will be required earlier than the preferred interval is desired to be at most a few percent. The design is based on independent processor-cache memory modules and common memory modules which communicate via redundant serial buses. All information processing and transmission is conducted in triplicate so that local voters in each module can correct errors. Modules can be retired and/or reassigned in any configuration. Reconfiguration is carried out routinely from second to second to search for latent faults in the voting and reconfiguration elements. Job assignments are all made on a floating basis, so that any processor triad is eligible to execute any job step. The core software in the FFMP will handle all fault detection, diagnosis, and recovery in such a way that applications programs do not need to be involved. Failure-rate models and numerical results are described for both permanent and intermittent faults. A dispatch probability model is also presented. Experience with an experimental emulation is described.",

            "abstract" : "SIFT (Software Implemented Fault Tolerance) is an ultrareliable computer for critical aircraft control applications that achieves fault tolerance by the replication of tasks among processing units. The main processing units are off-the-shelf minicomputers, with standard microcomputers serving as the interface to the I/O system. Fault isolation is achieved by using a specially designed redundant bus system to interconnect the proeessing units. Error detection and analysis and system reconfiguration are performed by software. Iterative tasks are redundantly executed, and the results of each iteration are voted upon before being used. Thus, any single failure in a processing unit or bus can be tolerated with triplication of tasks, and subsequent failures can be tolerated after reconfiguration. Independent execution by separate processors means that the processors need only be loosely synchronized, and a novel fault-tolerant synchronization method is described. The SIFT software is highly structured and is formally specified using the SRI-developed SPECIAL language. The correctness of SIFT is to be proved using a hierarchy of formal models. A Markov model is used both to analyze the reliability of the system and to serve as the formal requirement for the SIFT design. Axioms are given to characterize the high-level behavior of the system, from which a correctness statement has been proved. An engineering test version of SIFT is currently being built.",

The proposed approach, which is in the context of the model integrated mechatronics paradigm, exploits the function block (FB) construct for the design model and the real-time Java specification for the implementation one. Specific interpreters allow for the automatic generation of FB types implementation models in terms of real-time Java and the transformation of the applications FB networks to deployment specifications that are next utilized by a launcher to initialize and execute the control application on the proposed execution environment. The proposed approach favours deployment and re-deployment of distributed control applications and exploits the real-time specification for Java to meet their stringent nonfunctional requirements",

They are usually composed of monolithic applications that are almost impossible to integrate and even to expand. Even more, the many different types of commercial fieldbuses resulted in a wide diversity of devices and tools to support the development of Industrial Process Measurement and Control Systems (IPMCSs). The demand for integration, both during the development phase as well as during the operational phase is becoming more than evident. In this paper, we present CORFU, an OO framework to improve the engineering process of JPMCSs in terms of reliability, development time and degree of automation.

To put less burden on the developer it would be an advantage to have support for high-level communication primitives. One such primitive is the full synchronous composition (FSC) operator. This operator can be used to model the interaction between an arbitrary number of concurrently executing applications. This paper shows how to implement the FSC operator using an open communication standard for distributed control systems, IEC 61499. The operator is used in the supervisory control theory, a framework for automatic generation of provable correct supervisors. In manufacturing systems, for example, the supervisor might have to interact with a physically distributed plant. This paper concludes therefore by showing how to use the proposed implementation of the FSC operator to execute a supervisor against a physically distributed plant.",

            "abstract" : "This paper discusses the issues related to the correctness of agile manufacturing systems with distributed architectures. The corresponding development of software engineering methods targets the goal of easy-reconfigurable, self-organized software similar to that of the hardware. However, existing methods of software validation (manual testing or computer-aided simulation) are too slow to keep up with the pace of reconfigurations. In this paper we present an approach and a software tools to incorporate the formal verification to the practice of control engineering. The software package verification environment for distributed applications (VEDA) has been developed for model-based simulation and verification with a homogeneous graphical user interface. Net condition event systems are used for the modeling. VEDA deals with distributed controllers as defined in IEC 61499 and automatically generates the formal model of the controller with the given source code.",

            "abstract" : "The paper describes a methodological framework that aims to apply formal design and verification techniques in the development of industrial control systems, with particular regard to the domain of manufacturing machines. The methodology is based on an object-oriented approach, revisited in a mechatronic perspective, and is supported by the specification methods proposed by the UML language. This language, opportunely adapted to the application domain, permits to describe control system design models which are modular, reusable and independent from the implementation architecture. The implementation domain is taken into account only during the verification phase, in which it is necessary to identify a correct semantical interpretation according to the execution model of the computational platform. In particular, the different frameworks of the industrial standards IEC 61131-3 and IEC 61499 are considered and compared with each other. The paper shows that formal verification techniques can be applied to prove the correctness of the design specification or to guide its iterative refinement, thanks to a translation of the O-O model into the input language of the model checking tool SMV.",

            "abstract" : "In the context of fixed-priority scheduling, feasibility of a task set with non-preemptive scheduling does not imply the feasibility with preemptive scheduling and vice versa. We use the notion of preemption threshold, first introduced by Express Logic, in their ThreadX real-time operating system, to develop a scheduling model that subsumes both preemptive and non-preemptive fixed priority scheduling. Preemption threshold allows a task to only disable preemption of tasks up to a specified threshold priority. Tasks having priorities higher than the threshold are still allowed to preempt. With this new scheduling model, we show that schedulability is improved as compared to both the preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling models. We develop the equations for computing the worst-case response times, using the concept of level-i busy period. Some useful results about the generalized model are presented and an algorithm for optimal assignment of priority and preemption threshold is designed based on these results.",

By applying recent results in real-time scheduling theory to the subset of PGM employed by the US DARPA rapid prototyping of application-specific signal processors (RASSP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) benchmark application, we identify inherent real-time properties of nodes in a PGM graph, and demonstrate how these properties can be exploited to perform useful and important system-level analyses such as schedulability analysis, end-to-end latency analysis, and memory requirements analysis. More importantly, we develop relationships between properties such as latency and buffer bounds and show how one may be traded off for the other.",

            "abstract" : "Avionics mission computing systems have traditionally been scheduled statically. Static scheduling provides assurance of schedulability prior to run-time and can be implemented with low renting overhead. However static scheduling handles non-periodic processing inefficiently, and treats invocation-to-invocation variations in resource requirements inflexibly. As a consequence, processing resources am underutilized and the resulting systems are hard to adapt to meet worst-case processing requirements. Dynamic scheduling has the potential to offer relief from some of the restrictions imposed by strict static scheduling approaches. Potential benefits of dynamic scheduling include better tolerance for variations in activities, more flexible prioritization, and better CPU utilization in the presence of non-periodic activities. However the cost of these benefits is expected to be higher run-time scheduling overhead and additional application development complexity. This report reviews the implications of these tradeoffs for avionics mission computing systems and presents experimental results obtained using the Maximum Urgency First dynamic scheduling algorithm.",

            "abstract" : "Resource allocation for high-performance real-time applications is challenging due to the applications data-dependent nature, dynamic changes in their external environment, and limited resource availability in their target embedded system platforms. These challenges may be met by use of adaptive resource allocation (ARA) mechanisms that can promptly adjust resource allocation to changes in an applications resource needs, whenever there is a risk of failing to satisfy its timing constraints. By taking advantage of an applications adaptation capabilities, ARA eliminates the need for over-sizing real-time systems to meet worst-case application needs. This paper proposes a model for describing an applications adaptation capabilities and the runtime variation of its resource needs. The paper also proposes a satisfiability-driven set of performance metrics for capturing the impact of ARA mechanisms on the performance of adaptable real-time applications. The relevance of the proposed set of metrics is demonstrated experimentally, using a synthetic application designed to represent time-critical applications in C31 systems.",

Additionally a new approximation algorithm for the feasibility test of the sporadic and the generalized multiframe task system scheduled by earliest deadline first is presented. The new algorithm has polynomial complexity to solve the problem of schedulability analysis. The approximation error of the algorithm is bounded. In contrary to earlier work, where the error depends on the different deadlines of the tasks, the error of our algorithm depends only on the capacity of the chosen processor. It guarantees the acceptances on a processor with slightly higher capacity than the unknown optimal processor. While the algorithm is scalable and the run-time depends on the chosen error, a trade-off between running time and error is possible.",

MpSoC have been become the architecture of choice in many industries. Their heterogeneity inevitably increases with intellectual-property integration and component specialization. System integration is becoming a major challenge in their design. Simulation is state of the art in MpSoC performance verification, but it has conceptual disadvantages that become disabling as complexity increases. Formal approaches offer a systematic alternative. The article presents a technology that uses event model interfaces and a novel event flow mechanism that extends formal analysis approaches from real-time system design into the multiprocessor system on chip domain.",

            "abstract" : "The most precious resource in a computer system is no longer its processor, memory, disk, or network, but rather human attention. Aura aims to minimize distractions on a users attention, creating an environment that adapts to the users context and needs. Aura is specifically intended for pervasive computing environments involving wireless communication, wearable or handheld computers, and smart spaces. Human attention is an especially scarce resource in such environments, because the user is often preoccupied with walking, driving, or other real-world interactions. In addition, mobile computing poses difficult challenges such as intermittent and variable-bandwidth connectivity, concern for battery life, and the client resource constraints that weight and size considerations impose. To accomplish its ambitious goals, research in Aura spans every system level: from the hardware, through the operating system, to applications and end users. Underlying this diversity of concerns, Aura applies two broad concepts. First, it uses proactivity, which is a system layers ability to anticipate requests from a higher layer. In todays systems, each layer merely reacts to the layer above it. Second, Aura is self-tuning: layers adapt by observing the demands made on them and adjusting their performance and resource usage characteristics accordingly. Currently, system-layer behavior is relatively static. Both of these techniques will help lower demand for human attention.",

A coordination veneer is defined as an adaptation layer that customizes a general-purpose coordination middleware to a particular domain with minimal development effort. This technique allows developers to build highly-tailored coordination models while leveraging established models and middleware. We present three such veneers, the coordination models they embody, and the manner in which they were implemented The LIME middleware, which supplies tuple space based coordination in the ad hoc environment, serves as the implementation base for our veneers. These veneers cover diverse areas in ad hoc mobility: service discovery and provision, event registration and distribution, and secure tuple space access.",

Focusing on the engineering issues of self-adaptation in the presence of heterogeneous platforms, legacy applications, mobile users, and resource variable environments, we describe a new approach based on the following key ideas: 1) explicit representation of user tasks allows us to determine what service qualities are required of a given configuration; 2) decoupling task and preference specification from the lower level mechanisms that carry out those preferences provides a clean engineering separation of concerns between what is needed and how it is carried out; and 3) efficient algorithms allow us to calculate in real time near-optimal resource allocations and reallocations for a given task",

In this paper, we propose a novel routing scheme, which takes advantage of the social structure of underlying &#x2018;owners&#x2019; and their mobile devices in intermittently connected networks. We focus on routing by utilizing the social contact information. For example, device-owners come into contact with each other during attending regular meetings. We formulate the routing optimization problem, emphasizing the ever-changing network connectivity. Moreover, we propose an algorithm to infer the social structure by extracting contact information from online gathered traces. We further develop a routing protocol for intermittently connected networks based on that. The performance of our protocol is tested using real network traces. It is shown that the protocol is able to achieve a good delivery rate and latency, which is comparable with the optimal routing, and far outperforms the First Contact protocol. Our protocol is incrementally applicable to many current mobile ad hoc routing protocols.",

            "abstract" : "The increasing penetration of smart devices with networking capability form novel networks. Such networks, also referred as pocket switched networks (PSNs), are intermittently connected and represent a paradigm shift of forwarding data in an ad hoc manner. The social structure and interaction of users of such devices dictate the performance of routing protocols in PSNs. To that end, social information is an essential metric for designing forwarding algorithms for such types of networks. Previous methods relied on building and updating routing tables to cope with dynamic network conditions. On the downside, it has been shown that such approaches end up being cost ineffective due to the partial capture of the transient network behavior. A more promising approach would be to capture the intrinsic characteristics of such networks and utilize them in the design of routing algorithms. In this paper, we exploit two social and structural metrics, namely centrality and community, using real human mobility traces. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we design and evaluate BUBBLE, a novel social-based forwarding algorithm, that utilizes the aforementioned metrics to enhance delivery performance. Second, we empirically show that BUBBLE can substantially improve forwarding performance compared to a number of previously proposed algorithms including the benchmarking history-based PROPHET algorithm, and social-based forwarding SimBet algorithm.",

            "abstract" : "Message delivery in sparse mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is difficult due to the fact that the network graph is rarely (if ever) connected. A key challenge is to find a route that can provide good delivery performance and low end-to-end delay in a disconnected network graph where nodes may move freely. We cast this challenge as an information flow problem in a social network. This paper presents social network analysis metrics that may be used to support a novel and practical forwarding solution to provide efficient message delivery in disconnected delay-tolerant MANETs. These metrics are based on social analysis of a nodes past interactions and consists of three locally evaluated components: a nodes betweenness centrality (calculated using ego networks) and a nodes social similarity to the destination node and a nodes tie strength relationship with the destination node. We present simulations using three real trace data sets to demonstrate that by combining these metrics delivery performance may be achieved close to epidemic routing but with significantly reduced overhead. Additionally, we show improved performance when compared to PRoPHET routing.",

            "title" : "Efficient Routing in Intermittently Connected Mobile Networks: The Multiple-Copy Case",
            "abstract" : "Intermittently connected mobile networks are wireless networks where most of the time there does not exist a complete path from the source to the destination. There are many real networks that follow this model, for example, wildlife tracking sensor networks, military networks, vehicular ad hoc networks, etc. In this context, conventional routing schemes fail, because they try to establish complete end-to-end paths, before any data is sent. To deal with such networks researchers have suggested to use flooding-based routing schemes. While flooding-based schemes have a high probability of delivery, they waste a lot of energy and suffer from severe contention which can significantly degrade their performance. Furthermore, proposed efforts to reduce the overhead of flooding-based schemes have often been plagued by large delays. With this in mind, we introduce a new family of routing schemes that spray a few message copies into the network, and then route each copy independently towards the destination. We show that, if carefully designed, spray routing not only performs significantly fewer transmissions per message, but also has lower average delivery delays than existing schemes; furthermore, it is highly scalable and retains good performance under a large range of scenarios. Finally, we use our theoretical framework proposed in our 2004 paper to analyze the performance of spray routing. We also use this theory to show how to choose the number of copies to be sprayed and how to optimally distribute these copies to relays.",

            "abstract" : "This paper explores the robust routing of messages among individuals. Traditional routing assumes individuals provide messages to a device connected to a communications network that assumes all responsibility for message delivery. Although each individual may have links to multiple communication devices (office computer, PDA, cell phone), messages are delivered only if there is an end-to-end communication path between communication devices available to each individual. To improve robustness of communication, especially in dynamic ad hoc military networks, this paper models a novel routing paradigm using an integrated communication and social network. The understanding is that individuals can and do route messages through a social network in conjunction with the communication network. An example of this is an individual asking another in his immediate social network to place a call on his behalf when the official communication system is not convenient or is unavailable. We show that it is possible to route messages through the integrated social and communication network by: a) using the ORA social analysis tool to select normalized costs for the social and communication network links (e.g., to reflect the link delay, quality or robustness), and b) using the MONOPATI communication design tool to model the integrated socio-communication network as a graph and performing QoS routing. Results show that the robustness of message delivery can be improved by 5X through this joint routing, without unnecessary impacts on end to end latency.",

Real-time dynamic Web data such as news headlines, stock tickers, and auction updates need to be propagated to the users as soon as possible. However, AJAX still suffers from the limitations of the Webs request/response architecture which prevents servers from pushing real-time dynamic web data. Such applications usually use a pull style to obtain the latest updates, where the client actively requests the changes based on a predefined interval. It is possible to overcome this limitation by adopting a push style of interaction where the server broadcasts data when a change occurs on the server side. Both these options have their own trade-offs. This paper explores the fundamental limits of browser-based applications and analyzes push solutions for AJAX technology. It also shows the results of an empirical study comparing push and pull.",

In order to facilitate and leverage mobile interaction with services, we present a generic framework that combines semantic Web service technology and physical mobile interaction. This interaction paradigm uses mobile devices to extract information from augmented physical objects and use it for a more intuitive and convenient invocation of associated services. For that purpose, the presented framework exploits Web service descriptions for the automatic and dynamic generation of customizable user interfaces that support and facilitate physical mobile interaction. This generic approach to mobile interaction with services through the interaction with physical objects promises to meet the complementary development of the Internet of things. A user study with a prototype application for mobile ticketing confirms our concept and shows its limits",

The open-source Project JXTA was initiated a year ago to specify a standard set of protocols for ad hoc, pervasive, peer-to-peer computing as a foundation of the upcoming Web of Things. The following paper presents an up-to-date overview of the JXTA protocols and describes the latest implementation of the JXTA protocols in the C programming language. The paper discusses the overall architecture and trade off made to allow the JXTA-C implementation to run on a wide range of devices including supercomputers, servers, PCs, and memory-constrained embedded devices. The JXTA-C implementation delivers a small and efficient implementation of the JXTA protocols stack allowing the JXTA protocols to be embedded at the system level rather than the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) level for optimized performance and capabilities.",

            "abstract" : "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have promising industrial applications, since they reduce the gap between traditional enterprise systems and the real world. However, every particular application requires complex integration work, and therefore technical expertise, effort and time which prevents users from creating small tactical, ad-hoc applications using sensor networks. Following the success of Web 2.0 &#x201C;mashups&#x201D;, we propose a similar lightweight approach for combining enterprise services (e.g. ERPs) with WSNs. Specifically, we discuss the traditional integration solutions, propose and implement an alternative architecture where sensor nodes are accessible according to the REST principles. With this approach, the nodes become part of a &#x201C;Web of Things&#x201D; and interacting with them as well as composing their services with existing ones, becomes almost as easy as browsing the web.",

Many vendors embraced proprietary protocols, assuming that IP was too resource-intensive to be scaled down to operate on the microcontrollers and low-power wireless links used in LoWPAN settings.

This has become an interesting problem to both control engineers and roboticists. In this paper, we address this problem together with a constructive solution. First, we show that a falling cat problem is equivalent to the constructive nonlinear controllability problem. Thus, the same principle and algorithm used by a falling cat can be used for space robotic applications, such as reorientation of a satellite using rotors and attitude control of a space structure using internal motion, and other robotic tasks, such as dextrous manipulation with multifingered robotic hands and nonholonomic motion planning for mobile robots. Then, using ideas from Ritz approximation theory, we develop a simple algorithm for motion planning of a falling cat. Finally, we test the algorithm through simulation on two widely accepted models of a falling cat. It is interesting to note that one set of simulation results closely resembles the real trajectories employed by a falling cat.",

It permits the detection of unknown obstacles simultaneously with the steering of the mobile robot to avoid collisions and advance toward the target. The novelty of this approach, entitled the virtual force field method, lies in the integration of two known concepts: certainty grids for obstacle representation and potential fields for navigation. This combination is especially suitable for the accommodation of inaccurate sensor data as well as for sensor fusion and makes possible continuous motion of the robot with stopping in front of obstacles. This navigation algorithm also takes into account the dynamic behavior of a fast mobile robot and solves the local minimum trap problem. Experimental results from a mobile robot running at a maximum speed of 0.78 m/s demonstrate the power of the algorithm.",

For this purpose we combine audio-visual media forms and different types of haptic/tactile feedback. For the latter, we focus on the application of vibrational feedback, wind and water spray and heat. We follow a user-centered design approach and try to get user feedback as early as possible during the iterative design process. We present the conceptual idea of the Turtle surf project, and the iterative design and test of prototypes that helped us to refine the final design based on collected user feedback.",

This VE experimental system platform brings together complex technologies such as constraint-based assembly simulation, optical motion tracking technology, and real time 3D sound generation technology around a virtual reality workbench and a common software platform. A peg-in-a-hole and a Sener electronic box assembly task have been used as the task cases to conduct the human factor experiment, using sixteen participants. Both objective performance data (i.e., task completion time, TCT; and human performance error rate, HPER) and subjective opinions (i.e., questionnaires) on the utilization of auditory and visual feedback in a virtual assembly environment (VAE) have been gathered from the experiment. Results showed that the introduction of auditory and/or visual feedback into VAE did improve the assembly task performance. They also indicated that integrated feedback (auditory <italic>plus</italic> visual) offered better assembly task performance than either feedback used in isolation. Most participants preferred integrated feedback to either individual feedback (auditory or visual) or no feedback. The participants comments demonstrated that nonrealistic or inappropriate feedback had a negative effect on the task performance, and easily made them frustrated.",

            "abstract" : "Humanoid robotics and SLAM (simultaneous localisation and mapping) are certainly two of the most significant themes of the current worldwide robotics research effort, but the two fields have up until now largely run independent parallel paths, despite the obvious benefit to be gained in joining the two. The next major step forward in humanoid robotics will be increased autonomy, and the ability of a robot to create its own world map on the fly will be a significant enabling technology. Meanwhile, SLAM techniques have found most success with robot platforms and sensor configurations which are outside of the humanoid domain. Humanoid robots move with high linear and angular accelerations in full 3D, and normally only vision is available as an outward-looking sensor. Building on recently published work on monocular SLAM using vision, and on pattern generation, we show that real-time SLAM for a humanoid can indeed be achieved. Using HRP-2, we present results in which a sparse 3D map of visual landmarks is acquired on the fly using a single camera and demonstrated loop closing and drift-free 3D motion estimation within a typical cluttered indoor environment. This is achieved by tightly coupling the pattern generator, the robot odometry and inertial sensing to aid visual mapping within a standard EKF framework. To our knowledge this is the first implementation of real-time 3D SLAM for a humanoid robot able to demonstrate loop closing",

            "abstract" : "Despite the recent achievements in stable dynamic walking for many humanoid robots, relatively little navigation autonomy has been achieved. In particular, the ability to autonomously select foot placement positions to avoid obstacles while walking is an important step towards improved navigation autonomy for humanoids. We present a footstep planner for the Honda ASIMO humanoid robot that plans a sequence of footstep positions to navigate toward a goal location while avoiding obstacles. The possible future foot placement positions are dependent on the current state of the robot. Using a finite set of state-dependent actions, we use an A* search to compute optimal sequences of footstep locations up to a time-limited planning horizon. We present experimental results demonstrating the robot navigating through both static and dynamic known environments that include obstacles moving on predictable trajectories.",

            "abstract" : "This work presents methods for path planning and obstacle avoidance for the humanoid robot QRIO, allowing the robot to autonomously walk around in a home environment. For an autonomous robot, obstacle detection and localization as well as representing them in a map are crucial tasks for the success of the robot. Our approach is based on plane extraction from data captured by a stereo-vision system that has been developed specifically for QRIO. We briefly overview the general software architecture composed of perception, short and long term memory, behavior control, and motion control, and emphasize on our methods for obstacle detection by plane extraction, occupancy grid mapping, and path planning. Experimental results complete the description of our system.",

A two-stage approach is proposed for this goal. First, geometric and kinematic motion planner first computes collision-free paths for the humanoid robot. Then the dynamic pattern generator provides dynamically feasible humanoid motion including both locomotion and task execution such as object transportation or manipulation. If the generated dynamic motion causes collision due to dynamic movements, the planner go back to the planning stage to remove the collision by path reshaping. This iterative planning scheme enables robust planning against variation of task dynamics. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed planning method",

            "abstract" : "In this paper we address a task-driven motion generation method that allows a humanoid robot to make whole-body motions including support polygon reshaping to achieve the given tasks. In the proposed method, generalized inverse kinematics (IK) is employed with floating-base to generate humanoid whole-body motions that enable the robot to accomplish the tasks according to given priorities. During the motion, several criteria such as manipulability or end-effector position error are tracked. If the desired task cannot be done because of those criteria, a geometric planner for support polygon is activated. Then the whole-body motion is computed again always using the generalized IK solver including stepping motion that realizes the deformed support polygon by using dynamic walking pattern generator. This method provides a way to perform tasks that could not be done without changing the humanoids support state. We have verified the proposed framework through simulations and experiments using humanoid robot HRP-2",

            "abstract" : "In this paper, we investigate different possible strategies underlying the formation of human locomotor trajectories in goal-directed walking. Seven subjects were asked to walk within a motion capture facility from a fixed starting point and direction, and to cross over distant porches for which both position and direction in the room were changed over trials. Stereotyped trajectories were observed in the different subjects. The underlying idea to attack this question has been to relate this problem to an optimal control scheme: the trajectory is chosen according to some optimization principle. This is our basic starting assumption. The subject being viewed as a controlled system, we tried to identify several criteria that could be optimized. Is it the time to perform the trajectory? The length of the path? The minimum jerk along the path? We found that the variation (time derivative) of the curvature of the locomotor paths is minimized. Moreover, we show that the human locomotor trajectories are well approximated by the geodesics of a differential system minimizing the norm of the control. Such geodesics are made of arcs of clothoids. The clothoid or Cornu spiral is a curve, whose curvature grows with the distance from the origin.",

            "abstract" : "A development of humanoid robot HRP-2 is presented in this paper. HRP-2 is a humanoid robotics platform, which we developed in phase two of HRP. HRP was a humanoid robotics project, which had run by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan from 1998FY to 2002FY for five years. The ability of the biped locomotion of HRP-2 is improved so that HRP-2 can cope with uneven surface, can walk at two third level of human speed, and can walk on a narrow path. The ability of whole body motion of HRP-2 is also improved so that HRP-2 can get up by a humanoid robots own self if HRP-2 tips over safely. In this paper, the appearance design, the mechanisms, the electrical systems, specifications, and features upgraded from its prototype are also introduced.",

The robot has a trunk and two actuated telescopic legs with point feet which are coupled to the trunk by actuated hinges. There is compliance and damping in the hip and in the legs. The concept of open-loop control implies that all actuators of the system receive predetermined inputs that are never altered by any feedback interference. Only with the right choice of model parameters and actuator inputs is it possible to create such self-stabilizing motions exploiting the natural stability properties of the system. These unknowns have been determined using special-purpose stability-optimization methods. The resulting motion is not only stable, but also a more efficient form of forward motion than running for the investigated robot.",

            "abstract" : "Designing and controlling an anthropomorphic mechatronic system that is able to perform a dynamic running motion is a challenging task. One difficulty is that the fundamental principles of natural human running motions are not yet fully understood. The purpose of this paper is to show that mathematical optimization is a helpful tool to gain this insight into fast and complex motions. We present physics-based running motions for complex models of human-like running in three dimensions that have been generated by optimization. Running is modeled as a multiphase periodic motion with discontinuities, based on multibody system models of the locomotor system with actuators and spring-damper elements at each joint. The problem of generating gaits is formulated as offline optimal control problem and solved by an efficient direct multiple shooting method. We present optimization results using energy-related criteria and show that they have a close resemblance to running motions of humans. The results provide information about the internal forces and torques required to produce natural human running, as well as on the resulting kinematics.",

First, the dynamics of a biped robot is modeled as a running cart on a table which gives a convenient representation to treat ZMP. After reviewing conventional methods of ZMP based pattern generation, we formalize the problem as the design of a ZMP tracking servo controller. It is shown that we can realize such controller by adopting the preview control theory that uses the future reference. It is also shown that a preview controller can be used to compensate the ZMP error caused by the difference between a simple model and the precise multibody model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a simulation of walking on spiral stairs.",

            "abstract" : "Virtual environments (VEs) have been used successfully to train wayfinders to navigate through buildings and learn their layout. However, at the same time, for many, the VE deficiencies have reduced the effectiveness of VEs for training spatial tasks. In an effort to improve VE effectiveness, we conducted research to determine if certain unique capabilities of VEs could compensate for its deficiencies. Research participants were required to learn the layout or configuration of one floor of an office building as portrayed in a VE. To improve spatial learning, we developed three VE navigation training aids: local and global orientation cues, aerial views, and a themed environment enhanced with sights and sounds and divided into four distinct sectors. The navigation aids were provided during the training but were not available during testing of survey knowledge. Of the three training aids investigated, only the aerial views were effective in improving performance on the survey knowledge tests. The effectiveness of the navigation aids seemed to depend on how they were used during training. A retention test given one week after training indicated that spatial knowledge acquired in a VE diminished little over the one-week retention interval.",

            "abstract" : "Existing navigation techniques do not scale well to large virtual worlds. We present a new technique, navigation with place representations and visible landmarks that scales from town-sized to planet-sized worlds. Visible landmarks make distant landmarks visible and allow users to travel relative to those landmarks with a single gesture. Actual and symbolic place representations allow users to detect and travel to more distant locations with a small number of gestures. The worlds semantic place hierarchy determines which visible landmarks and place representations users can see at any point in time. We present experimental results demonstrating that our technique allows users to navigate more efficiently than a modified panning and zooming W1M, completing within-place navigation tasks 22% faster and between-place tasks 38% faster on average.",

We present a survey on prior research with large high-resolution displays. In the hardware configurations section we examine systems including multi-monitor workstations, reconfigurable projector arrays, and others. Rendering and the data pipeline are addressed with an overview of current technologies. We discuss many applications for large high-resolution displays such as automotive design, scientific visualization, control centers, and others. Quantifying the effects of large high-resolution displays on human performance and other aspects is important as we look toward future advances in display technology and how it is applied in different situations. Interacting with these displays brings a different set of challenges for HCI professionals, so an overview of some of this work is provided. Finally, we present our view of the top ten greatest challenges in large highresolution displays.",

The latest system, called GSS (Ground Surface Simulator), inherits the features of two previous locomotion interfaces, viz. ATLAS (ATR Locomotion interface for Active Self-motion) and ALF (ALive Floor). GSS also incorporates two different features not found in ordinary treadmills: a movable belt and an active belt-speed controller. We built an initial prototype of GSS and developed a method that presents bumpy surfaces that are free from the mechanical limitations inherent in prior designs. Experimental results showed that a subject could distinguish a 1% difference in the virtual slope on the GSS.",

            "abstract" : "In most applications of virtual environments (VEs), like training and design evaluation, a good sense of orientation is needed in the VE. Orientation performance when moving around in the real world relies on visual as well as proprioceptive feedback. However, the navigation metaphors which are used to move around the VE often lack proprioceptive feedback. Furthermore, the visual feedback in a VE is often relatively poor compared to the visual feedback available in the real world. Therefore, we have quantified the influence of visual and proprioceptive feedback on orientation performance in VEs. Subjects were immersed in a virtual forest and were asked to turn specific angles using three navigation metaphors, differing in the kind of proprioceptive feedback which is provided (no proprioceptive feedback, vestibular feedback, and vestibular and kinesthetic feedback). The results indicate that the most accurate turn performance is found when kinesthetic feedback is present, in a condition where subjects use their legs to turn around. This indicates that incorporating this kind of feedback in navigation metaphors is quite beneficial. Orientation on only the visual component is most inaccurate, leading to progressively larger undershoots for larger angles.",

            "abstract" : "This paper presents an interactive hierarchical motion control system dedicated to the animation of human figure locomotion in virtual environments. As observed in gait experiments, controlling the trajectories of the feet during gait is a precise end-point control task. Inverse kinematics with optimal approaches are used to control the complex relationships between the motion of the body and the coordination of its legs. For each step, the simulation of the support leg is executed first, followed by the swing leg, which incorporates the position of the pelvis from the support leg. That is, the foot placement of the support leg serves as the kinematics constraint while the position of the pelvis is defined through the evaluation of a control criteria optimization. Then, the swing leg movement is defined to satisfy two criteria in order: collision avoidance and control criteria optimization. Finally, animation attributes, such as controlling parameters and pre-processed motion modules, are applied to achieve a variety of personalities and walking styles.",

The lack of the normal complement of cues may contribute to cybersickness and may affect operator performance. Previously (1998) we described the effect of adding vestibular cues during passive linear motion and showed an unexpected dominance of the vestibular cue in determining the magnitude of the perceived motion. Here we vary the relative magnitude of the visual and vestibular cues and describe a simple linear summation model that predicts the resulting perceived magnitude of motion. The model suggests that designers of virtual reality displays should add vestibular information in a ratio of one to four with the visual motion to obtain convincing and accurate performance.",

For this aim, two psychophysical experiments have been conducted. The first experiment consisted of a compliance discrimination, between two virtual springs hand-operated by means of the Spaceball/sup TM/. In this experiment, the stiffness (or compliance) JND turned out to be 6%. The second experiment assessed stiffness discrimination between a virtual spring and the equivalent spring in reality. In this case, the stiffness (or compliance) JND was found to be 13.4%. These results are consistent with previous outcomes on manual discrimination of compliance. Consequently, this consistency reveals that the passive apparatus that was used can, to some extent, simulate haptic information. In addition, a final test indicated that the proprioceptive sense of the subjects was blurred by visual feedback. This gave them the illusion of using a nonisometric device.",

Participants were asked to estimate the angles of turns made during a passive visual navigation. Sometimes, during a turn, a haptic feedback was sent to the dominant hand of the participants. This haptic feedback consisted in rotating the participants fist by the same angular value as the visual turn. The presence of haptic feedback globally influenced the performances of the participants. On average, with haptic feedback, the participants less under-estimated the angles the turns made in the visual navigation. These results suggest that the perception of self-motion could be improved in virtual reality by using an appropriate haptic feedback. Haptic stimulation during navigation could partially substitute for the missing information provided by proprioception and vestibular system.",

Depending on the type of tasks performed by the user, our algorithms compute automatic placement of the user viewpoint to navigate through the scene, to display the near-optimal views, and to reposition the viewpoint for haptic visualization. This is accomplished by conjecturing the users intent based on the users actions, the object geometry, and intra- and inter-object occlusion relationships. These algorithms have been implemented and interfaced with both a 3-DOF and a 6-DOF PHANToM arms.

The purpose of the present study was to better understand and quantify the effects of visual scene variables: visual polarity and visual scene rotation on postural stability during treadmill locomotion. During 60 s trials, subjects walked at 4.0 km/h while viewing a monoscopic, passive-immersive, 3D virtual room environment that contained either polarized or nonpolarized content and was back-projected onto a screen 1.5 m in front of them, one at a time. Scenes remained static for the first 30 s, then rotated about the roll, pitch, or yaw axis of the room at a constant rate of 30&#176;/s for the remaining 30 s. Each subject saw each combination of visual polarity (polarized, nonpolarized) and scene rotation direction (roll, pitch, yaw) for three separate trials. There was a main effect of visual polarity on variability in torso linear X (fore&#8211;aft) position and torso roll and pitch angular orientations with polarized scenes causing more variability than nonpolarized scenes. For the polarized scenes only, variability in torso roll, pitch, and yaw angular orientations was increased for corresponding scene rotation directions, respectively. In general, rotating visual scenes caused increased variability in torso motion compared to static scenes. Visual polarity is an important consideration when designing virtual environment motion simulations.",

            "abstract" : "This paper describes the use of users focus point to improve some visual effects in virtual environments (VE). First, we describe how to retrieve users focus point in the 3D VE using an eye-tracking system. Then, we propose the adaptation of two rendering techniques which aim at improving users sensations during first-person navigation in VE using his/her focus point: (1) a camera motion which simulates eyes movement when walking, i.e., corresponding to vestibulo-ocular and vestibulocollic reflexes when the eyes compensate body and head movements in order to maintain gaze on a specific target, and (2) a depth-of-field (DoF) blur effect which simulates the fact that humans perceive sharp objects only within some range of distances around the focal distance. Second, we describe the results of an experiment conducted to study users subjective preferences concerning these visual effects during first-person navigation in VE. It showed that participants globally preferred the use of these effects when they are dynamically adapted to the focus point in the VE. Taken together, our results suggest that the use of visual effects exploiting users focus point could be used in several VR applications involving first- person navigation such as the visit of architectural site, training simulations, video games, etc.",

            "abstract" : "The literature often suggests that proprioceptive and especially vestibular cues are required for navigation and spatial orientation tasks involving rotations of the observer. To test this notion, we conducted a set of experiments in virtual environments in which only visual cues were provided. Participants had to execute turns, reproduce distances, or perform triangle completion tasks. Most experiments were performed in a simulated 3D field of blobs, thus restricting navigation strategies to path integration based on optic flow. For our experimental set-up (half-cylindrical 180 deg. projection screen), optic flow information alone proved to be sufficient for untrained participants to perform turns and reproduce distances with negligible systematic errors, irrespective of movement velocity. Path integration by optic flow was sufficient for homing by triangle completion, but homing distances were biased towards the mean response. Additional landmarks that were only temporarily available did not improve homing performance. However, navigation by stable, reliable landmarks led to almost perfect homing performance. Mental spatial ability test scores correlated positively with homing performance, especially for the more complex triangle completion tasks&#8212;suggesting that mental spatial abilities might be a determining factor for navigation performance. In summary, visual path integration without any vestibular or kinesthetic cues can be sufficient for elementary navigation tasks like rotations, translations, and triangle completion.",

Extensive data for the human operators describing function are taken for a wide range of vehicle dynamics under conditions of visual cues only, roll-motion cues only, and simultaneous visual and roll-motion cues. Addition of roll-motion cues to visual cues permits the human operator to increase his phase lead at frequencies above 3 rad/s. This allows him to increase the system open-loop gain without a loss of system stability, and thus to reduce the system tracking error. Experimental results indicate that in a compensatory system with a disturbance input, any condition in which additional human operator lead at frequencies above 3 rad/s would be useful is a condition in which roll-motion cues would aid.",

Previous research in virtual environments (VEs) has shown that this so-called path integration process is inaccurate in the case that only visual motion stimuli are present, which may lead to disorientation. In an experiment, we investigated whether participants can calibrate this visual path integration process for rotations; in other words, can they learn the relation between visual flow and the angle that they traverse in the VE? Results show that, by providing participants with knowledge of results (KR), they can indeed calibrate the biases in their path integration process, and also maintain their improved level of performance on a retention test the next day.",

We conducted a study that investigated how handling real objects and self-avatar visual fidelity affects performance and sense of presence on a spatial cognitive manual task. We compared participants performance of a block arrangement task in both a real-space environment and several virtual and hybrid environments. The results showed that manipulating real objects in a VE brings task performance closer to that of real space, compared to manipulating virtual objects.

            "abstract" : "This paper describes a fast method of correcting for optical distortion in head-mounted displays (HMDs). Since the distorted display surface in an HMD is not rectilinear, the shape and location of the graphics window used with the display must be chosen carefully, and some corrections made to the predistortion model. A distortion correction might be performed with optics that reverse the distortion caused by HMD lenses, but such optics can be expensive and offer a correction for only one specific HMD. Integer incremental methods or a lookup table might be used to calculate the correction, but an I/O bottleneck makes this impractical in software. Instead, a texture map may be defined that approximates the required optical correction. Recent equipment advances allow undistorted images to be input into texture mapping hardware at interactive rates. Built in filtering handles predistortion aliasing artifacts.",

            "abstract" : "The ability to accurately estimate distance is an essential component of navigating large-scale spaces. Although the factors that influence distance estimation have been a topic of research in real-world environments for decades and are well known, research on distance estimation in virtual environments (VEs) has only just begun. Initial investigations of distance estimation in VEs suggest that observers are less accurate in estimating distance in VEs than in the real world (Lampton et al., 1995). Factors influencing distance estimates may be divided into those affecting perceived distance (visual cues only) and those affecting traversed distance to include visual, cognitive, and proprioceptive cues. To assess the contribution of the various distance cues in VEs, two experiments were conducted. The first required a static observer to estimate the distance to a cylinder placed at various points along a 130-foot hallway. This experiment examined the effects of floor texture, floor pattern, and object size on distance estimates in a VE. The second experiment required a moving observer to estimate route segment distances and total route distances along four routes, each totaling 1210 feet. This experiment assessed the effects of movement method, movement speed, compensatory cues, and wall texture density. Results indicate that observers underestimate distances both in VEs and in the real world, but the underestimates are more extreme in VEs. Texture did not reliably affect the distance estimates, providing no compensation for the gross underestimates of distance in VE. Traversing a distance improves the ability to estimate that distance, but more natural means of moving via a treadmill do not necessarily improve distance estimates over traditional methods of moving in VE (e.g., using a joystick). The addition of compensatory cues (tone every 10 feet traversed on alternate route segments) improves VE distance estimation to almost perfect performance.",

Twenty-four architects toured either a real museum gallery or a realtime computer generated model of the same gallery under one of three increasingly inclusive viewing conditions, i.e., looking at a monitor, viewing through stereoscopic head-mounted displays without and with head-position tracking. Subjects were asked to perform spatial dimension, orientation and evaluation tasks. The most significant results indicate that subjects consistently underestimate the dimensions of the gallery in all three computer simulation conditions when compared to touring the real gallery. The most inclusive viewing condition yields underestimates for spatial dimensions which are significantly greater than the other two simulation conditions.",

            "abstract" : "This paper argues that a scientific basis for &#8220;presence&#8221; as its usually understood in virtual environments research, can not be established on the basis of postexperience presence questionnaires alone. To illustrate the point, an arbitrary mental attribute called &#8220;colorfulness of the experience&#8221; is conjured up, and a set of questions administered to 74 respondents with an online questionnaire. The results suggested that colorfulness of yesterdays experiences was associated with the extent to which a person accomplished their tasks, and also associated with yesterday being a &#8220;good&#8221;, &#8220;pleasant&#8221;, but not frustrating day. The meaning lessness of this analysis illustrates that the equivalent methodology used by presence researchers, may, similarly, bring into being the idea of presence in the minds of VE participants. However, it is argued that there can be no evidence on this methodological basis that presence played any role in their actual mental activity or behavior at the time of the experience. It is concluded that presence researchers must move away from heavy reliance on questionnaires in order to make any progress in this area.",

Participants freely navigated in a simple virtual environment and repeatedly made magnitude estimations of exocentric distances. Distances were generally overestimated. An exponential model (Stevens power law) fit the data, and exponent estimates were generally less than unity. Geometric field of view (GFOV) and the presence of error-corrective feedback were found to have the strongest effect on accuracy. In fact, distance perception was nearly veridical when made with an 80 deg. GFOV and when receiving feedback. Display type (head-mounted versus desktop) and the presence of additional perspective cues were less influential.",

In this paper an algorithm allowing efficient culling of the invisible portion of the rendered model is presented. Our approach uses a spatial hierarchy to represent the topology of the model. For a current viewpoint a set of polygonal occluders is determined that are used to build the occlusion tree. In the occlusion tree occlusion volumes of the selected occluders are merged. Visibility from the viewpoint is determined by processing the spatial hierarchy and classifying the visibility of its regions. In this process the occlusion tree is used to determine the viewpoint-to-region visibility efficiently. The algorithm is well-suited for complex models where large occluders are present.",

            "abstract" : "Presence research relies heavily on empirical experiments involving subjects in mediated environments. Since presence is a complex, multidimensional concept, experiments on presence can be extremely resource intensive and produce large amounts of data of different types. As the presence community matures, we would like to suggest that data collected in experiments be made publicly available to the community. This will allow the verification of experimental results, comparison of results of experiments carried out in different laboratories, and evaluation of new data-analysis methods. This will, eventually, lead to consistency in approaches and increased confidence in results. In this paper we present the complete dataset from a large-scale experiment that we have carried out in highly immersive virtual reality. We describe the data we have gathered and give examples of the types of analysis that can be made based on that data.",

            "abstract" : "Recently, we reported that group subjective measures of presence as well as observers postural responses are sensitive to increasing the realism of a display with motion content, by the addition of stereoscopic information, using a 20-inch stereoscopic screen with an effective horizontal field of view of 28 deg. (Freeman, Avons, Meddis, Pearson, &amp; IJsselsteijn, 2000). The experiment presented here employed a large projection display with a 50 deg. horizontal field of view showing a rally car traversing a curved track at speed. The independent variables included image motion and stereoscopic presentation as within-subjects factors and screen size as a between-subjects factor. Dependent variables included subjective measures of presence, vection, involvement, and sickness, as well as observers lateral postural responses, which served as a candidate objective corroborative measure of presence. Results demonstrated a noisy yet positive effect of stereoscopic presentation on the lateral postural responses. Post-test subjective ratings revealed a significant effect of stereoscopic presentation on the subjective judgments of presence, but not on those of vection, involvement, or sickness. Image motion had a large and significant effect on the subjective judgments of presence, vection, and involvement. The effect of image motion was considerably larger than that of stereoscopic viewing. By comparing results between experiments, a large effect of screen size on subjective presence ratings could be demonstrated, but only for the video stimulus that contained motion. The postural response measure did not differentiate between screen sizes, thus limiting its utility as an objective corroborative measure of presence, although further research is required to be able to be more firm in our conclusion regarding this issue.",

The VE used in the study includes two rooms: the first is normal and non-threatening; the second is designed to evoke a fear/stress response. Participants were assigned to either a low latency (/spl sim/50 ms) or high latency (/spl sim/90 ms) group. Participants in the low latency condition had a higher self-reported sense of presence and a statistically higher change in heart rate between the two rooms than did those in the high latency condition. There were no significant relationships between latency and simulator sickness.",

At different times during an experience, a participant will occasionally switch between interpreting the totality of sensory inputs as forming the VE or the real world. The number of transitions from virtual to real is counted, and, using some simplifying assumptions, a probabilistic Markov chain model can be constructed to model these transitions. This model can be used to estimate the equilibrium probability of being &#8220;present&#8221; in the VE. This technique was applied in the context of an experiment to assess the relationship between presence and body movement in an immersive VE. The movement was that required by subjects to reach out and touch successive pieces on a three-dimensional chess board. The experiment included twenty subjects, ten of whom had to reach out to touch the chess pieces (the active group) and ten of whom only had to click a handheld mouse button (the control group). The results revealed a significant positive association in the active group between body movement and presence. The results lend support to interaction paradigms that are based on maximizing the match between sensory data and proprioception.",

Based on the results of a pilot study we have quantified to which degree users can unknowingly be redirected in order to guide them through an arbitrarily sized VE in which virtual paths differ from the paths tracked in the real working space. We further introduce the concept of dynamic passive haptics which enables a user to interact with a VE. By means of this concept any number of virtual objects can be mapped to real proxy objects having similar haptic properties, i. e., size, shape and surface structure, such that the user can sense these virtual objects by touching their real world counterparts. Thus dynamic passive haptics provides the user with the illusion of interacting with a desired virtual object by redirecting her/him to the corresponding proxy object.",

            "abstract" : "As virtual environment (VE) technology becomes accessible to (and affordable for) an ever-widening audience of users, the demand for VE applications will increase. Tools that assist and facilitate the development of these applications, therefore, will also be in demand. To support our efforts in quickly designing and implementing VE applications, we have developed the Simple Virtual Environment (SVE) library. In this article, we describe the characteristics of the library that support the development of both simple and complex VE applications. Simple applications are created by novice programmers or for rapid prototyping. More-complex applications incorporate new user input and output devices, as well as new techniques for user interaction, rendering, or animation. The SVE library provides more-comprehensive support for developing new VE applications and better supports the various device configurations of VE applications than current systems for 3-D graphical applications. The development of simple VE applications is supported through provided default interaction, rendering, and user input and output device handling. The librarys framework includes an execution framework that provides structure for incrementally adding complexity to selected tasks of an application, and an environment model that provides a layer of abstraction between the application and the device configuration actually used at runtime. This design supports rapid development of VE applications through incremental development, code reuse, and independence from hardware resources during the development.",

A rate control strategy employing sidestep is compared to a proportional control strategy employing head gaze and torso trigger. The maneuvering task involves walking down a narrow corridor and avoiding obstacles that are placed at different separations to change the task difficulty. The performance metric was the number of times a subject collided with the obstacles or the corridors walls. Traversal time and traversal distance were also characterized. The proportional control strategy was clearly found to permit more-precise maneuvering.",

            "abstract" : "Virtual environment displays arose from vehicle simulation and teleoperations technology of the 1960s. They are interactive, head-referenced computer displays that give users the illusion of displacement to another location. Different terms have been applied to the illusion. Some, like the oxymoronic artificial reality and virtual reality, suggest much higher performance than current technology can generally provide. Others, like cyberspace are puzzling neologisms. Expressions like virtual worlds and virtual environment seem preferable because they are linguistically conservative, relating to well-established terms like virtual image. In fact, we can define virtual environments as interactive, virtual image displays enhanced by special processing and by nonvisual display modalities, such as auditory and haptic, to convince users that they are immersed in a synthetic space. Why are these displays useful? Who uses them? How are they developed? The article addresses these and other questions related to this emerging technology.",

By itself, the GroundCam provides high frequency, high resolution relative position information similar to an inertial navigation system, but with significantly less drift. When coupled with a wide area tracking modality via a complementary Kalman filter, the hybrid tracker becomes a powerful base for indoor and outdoor mobile mixed reality work",

            "abstract" : "To enhance presence, facilitate sensory motor performance, and avoid disorientation or nausea, virtual-reality applications require the perception of a stable environment. End-end tracking latency (display lag) degrades this illusion of stability and has been identified as a major fault of existing virtual-environment systems. Oscillopsia refers to the perception that the visual world appears to swim about or oscillate in space and is a manifestation of this loss of perceptual stability of the environment. The effects of end-end latency and head velocity on perceptual stability in a virtual environment were investigated psychophysically. Subjects became significantly more likely to report oscillopsia during head movements when end-end latency or head velocity were increased. It is concluded that perceptual instability of the world arises with increased head motion and increased display lag. Oscillopsia is expected to be more apparent in tasks requiring real locomotion or rapid head movement.",

This frequently happens when people move around small virtual environments (VEs), searching for targets. In three experiments, participants searched small-scale VEs using different movement interfaces, collision response algorithms, and fields of view. Participants searches were most efficient in terms of distance traveled, time taken, and path followed when the simplest form of movement (view direction) was used in conjunction with a response algorithm that guided (&#8220;slipped&#8221;) them around obstacles when collisions occurred. Unexpectedly, and in both immersive and desktop VEs, participants often had great difficulty finding the targets, despite the fact that participants could see the whole VE if they stood in one place and turned around.

We believe that natural interaction and a high level of immersion facilitates the education of communication skills.

The study confirmed that the level of immersion contributed significantly to the experience, and participants reported that the system is a powerful tool for teaching and training.

            "abstract" : "This paper describes an experiment to assess the anxiety responses of people giving 5 min. presentations to virtual audiences consisting of eight male avatars. There were three different types of audience behavior: an emotionally neutral audience that remained static throughout the talk, a positive audience that exhibited friendly and appreciative behavior towards the speaker, and a negative audience that exhibited hostile and bored expressions throughout the talk. A second factor was immersion: half of the forty subjects experienced the virtual seminar room through a head-tracked, head-mounted display and the remainder on a desktop system. Responses were measured using the standard Personal Report of Confidence as a Public Speaker (PRCS), which was elicited prior to the experiment and after each talk. Several other standard psychological measures such as SCL-90-R (for screening for psychological disorder), the SAD, and the FNE were also measured prior to the experiment. Other response variables included subjectively assessed somaticization and a subject self-rating scale on performance during the talk. The subjects gave the talk twice each to a different audience, but in the analysis only the results of the first talk are presented, thus making this a between-groups design. The results show that post-talk PRCS is significantly and positively correlated to PRCS measured prior to the experiment in the case only of the positive and static audiences. For the negative audience, prior PRCS was not a predictor of post-PRCS, which was higher than for the other two audiences and constant. The negative audience clearly provoked an anxiety response irrespective of the normal level of public speaking confidence of the subject. The somatic response also showed a higher level of anxiety for the negative audience than for the other two, but self-rating was generally higher only for the static audience, each of these results taking into account prior PRCS.",

            "abstract" : "This paper describes an experiment that compares behavior in small groups when its members carry out a task in a virtual environment (VE) and then continue the same task in a similar, real-world environment. The purpose of the experiment was not to examine task performance, but to compare various aspects of the social relations among the group members in the two environments. Ten groups of three people each, who had never met before, met first in a shared VE and carried out a task that required the identification and solution of puzzles that were presented on pieces of paper displayed around the walls of a room. The puzzle involved identifying that the same-numbered words across all the pieces of paper formed a riddle or saying. The group continued this task for fifteen minutes, and then stopped to answer a questionnaire. The group then reconvened in the real world and continued the same task. The experiment also required one of the group members to continually monitor a particular one of the others in order to examine whether social discomfort could be generated within a VE. In each group, there was one immersed person with a head-mounted display and head-tracking and two non-immersed people who experienced the environment on a workstation display. The results suggest that the immersed person tended to emerge as the leader in the virtual group, but not in the real meeting. Group accord tended to be higher in the real meeting than in the virtual meeting. Socially conditioned responses such as embarrassment could be generated in the virtual meeting, even though the individuals were presented to one another by very simple avatars. The study also found a positive relationship between presence of being in a place and copresence&#8212;the sense of being with the other people. Accord in the group increased with presence, the performance of the group, and the presence of women in the group. The study is seen as part of a much larger planned study, for which this experiment was used to begin to understand the issues involved in comparing real and virtual meetings.",

A system that allows medical students to interview a life-size virtual patient using natural speech and gestures was used as a platform for this comparison. Study participants interviewed either a virtual patient or a standardized patient, an actor trained to represent a medical condition. Subtle yet substantial differences were found in the participants&#146; rapport with the patient and the flow of the conversation. The virtual patient&#146;s limited expressiveness was a significant source of these differences. However, overall task performance was similar, as were perceptions of the educational value of the interaction.",

            "abstract" : "This paper presents steering behaviors that control autonomous vehicles populating roadways in virtual urban environments. Behavior programming is facilitated by a set of representations of the environment that use convenient frames of reference in natural coordinate systems. Roadway surfaces are modeled as three-dimensional ribbons that make the local orientation of the road explicit and allow relative distances on the road to be simply computed. Roads and intersections are connected to form a ribbon network. An egocentric representation called a path melds road and intersection segments into a single, continuous ribbon that captures the vehicles short-term plan of navigation. A topological structure called a route supports wayfinding. We describe how the interrelated ribbon, path, and route representations are used to build multi-component behaviors that plan routes and safely navigate through traffic filled road networks - tracking lanes, shifting lanes to avoid congestion, anticipating lane changes needed to make turns dictated by the route, negotiating intersections, and respecting the rules of the road.",

EOF represents information about the layout of streets and sidewalks, the rules that govern behavior on roads and walkways, and the locations of agents with respect to navigable structures. The framework serves as the substrate on which behavior programs for autonomous vehicles and pedestrians are built. Pathways are modeled as ribbons in space. The ribbon structure provides a natural coordinate frame for defining the local geometry of navigable surfaces. EOF includes a powerful runtime interface supported by robust and efficient code for locating objects on the ribbon network, for mapping between Cartesian and ribbon coordinates, and for determining behavioral constraints imposed by the environment",

            "abstract" : "Augmented reality systems allow users to interact with real and computer-generated objects by displaying 3D virtual objects registered in a users natural environment. Applications of this powerful visualization tool include previewing proposed buildings in their natural settings, interacting with complex machinery for purposes of construction or maintenance training, and visualizing in-patient medical data such as ultrasound. In all these applications, computer-generated objects must be visually registered with respect to real-world objects in every image the user sees. If the application does not maintain accurate registration, the computer-generated objects appear to float around in the users natural environment without having a specific 3D spatial position. Registration error is the observed displacement in the image between the actual and intended positions of virtual objects.",

The tactual sensation scaling was first performed to obtain a linear sensation scale of the display by means of the JND (just noticeable difference) method. One-dimensional curves on the scale were displayed to investigate human sensitivity to an intensity change rate. A tactile texture presentation method based on the image of an object surface is introduced, and two kinds of experiment were performed. Texture discrimination is the first, in which the effect of texture element size on the correct separation was discussed. Then the sensations produced by the display and that by a real object were compared using several samples that had vertical lines and did not contain low frequencies. The results are summarized and further research directions are discussed.",

            "abstract" : "Tactile display devices use an array of pins mounted in the form of a matrix to present three-dimensional shapes to the user by raising and lowering the pins. With a denser matrix of mounted pins, it can be expected that shape identification will become easier and the time required for identification will also become shorter, but that problems of difficulty in fabrication will arise. It is necessary to consider such trade-offs in the development of such devices. The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of pin pitch on shape identification as part of the fundamental investigation of this subject. The experiment used three tactile display devices with pin pitches of 2 mm, 3 mm and 5 mm for geometrical shape identification, with response time and rate of misidentification taken as the performance data. Surfaces, edges and vertices of three-dimensional shapes were used as the shape primitives for displayed shapes and several of each type were selected for presentation. The results obtained revealed that performance has different relationships to pin pitch with different shape primitives.",

            "abstract" : "The need for efficient interconnect architectures beyond the conventional time-division multiplexing (TDM) protocol-based interconnects has been brought on by the continued increase of required communication bandwidth and concurrency of small-scale digital systems. To improve the overall system performance without increasing communication resources and complexity, this paper presents a cost-effective interconnect architecture, communication protocol, and signaling technology that exploits parallelism in board-level communication, resulting in shorter latency and higher concurrency on a shared bus or link: the proposed source synchronous CDMA interconnect (SSCDMA-I) enables dual concurrent transactions on a single wire line as well as flexible input/output (I/O) reconfiguration. The SSCDMA-I utilizes 2-bit orthogonal CDMA coding and a variation of source synchronous clocking for multilevel superposition; a single 3-level SSCDMA-I line operates as if it consists of dual virtual time-multiplexed interconnects, which exploits communication parallelism with a reduced number of pins, wires, and complexity. The unique multiple access capability of the SSCDMA-I improves real-time communication between multiple semiconductor intellectual property (IP) blocks on a shared link or bus by reducing the bus contention interference from simultaneous traffic requests and by taking advantage of shorter request latency. The prototype transceiver chip is implemented in 0.18-m CMOS and the 10-cm test PC board system achieves an aggregate data rate of 2.5 Gb/s/pin between four off-chip (2Tx-to-2Rx) I/Os.",

            "abstract" : "In this paper, we address the severe performance gap caused by high processor clock rates and slow DRAM accesses. We show that, even with an aggressive, next-generation memory system using four Direct Rambus channels and an integrated one-megabyte level-two cache, a processor still spends over half its time stalling for L2 misses. Our experimental analysis begins with an effort to tune our baseline memory system aggressively: incorporating optimizations to reduce DRAM row buffer misses, reordering miss accesses to reduce queuing delay, and adjusting the L2 block size to match each channel organization. We show that there is a large gap between the block sizes at which performance is best and at which miss rate is minimized. Using those results, we evaluate a hardware prefetch unit integrated with the L2 cache and memory controllers. By issuing prefetches only when the Rambus channels are idle, prioritizing them to maximize DRAM row buffer hits, and giving them low replacement priority, we achieve a 65 percent speedup across 10 of the 26 SPEC2000 benchmarks, without degrading the performance of the others. With eight Rambus channels, these 10 benchmarks improve to within 10 percent of the performance of a perfect L2 cache.",

Unfortunately, little raw data on failures in large IT installations is publicly available. This paper analyzes failure data recently made publicly available by one of the largest high-performance computing sites. The data has been collected over the past 9 years at Los Alamos National Laboratory and includes 23000 failures recorded on more than 20 different systems, mostly large clusters of SMP and NUMA nodes. We study the statistics of the data, including the root cause of failures, the mean time between failures, and the mean time to repair. We find for example that average failure rates differ wildly across systems, ranging from 20-1000 failures per year, and that time between failures is modeled well by a Weibull distribution with decreasing hazard rate. From one system to another, mean repair time varies from less than an hour to more than a day, and repair times are well modeled by a lognormal distribution",

            "abstract" : "Over the past two decades, rollback-recovery via checkpoint-restart has been used with reasonable success for long-running applications, such as scientific workloads that take from few hours to few months to complete. Currently, several commercial systems and publicly available libraries exist to support various flavors of checkpointing. Programmers typically use these systems if they are satisfactory or otherwise embed checkpointing support themselves within the application. In this paper, we project the performance and functionality of checkpointing algorithms and systems as we know them today into the future. We start by surveying the current technology roadmap and particularly how Peta-Flop capable systems may be plausibly constructed in the next few years. We consider how rollback-recovery as practiced today will fare when systems may have to be constructed out of thousands of nodes. Our projections predict that, unlike current practice, the effect of rollback-recovery may play a more prominent role in how systems may be configured to reach the desired performance level. System planners may have to devote additional resources to enable rollback-recovery and the current practice of using cheap commodity systems to form large-scale clusters may face serious obstacles. We suggest new avenues for research to react to these trends.",

            "abstract" : "Software failures are now known to be a dominant source of system outages. Several studies and much anecdotal evidence point to &#x201C;software aging&#x201D; as a common phenomenon, in which the state of a software system degrades with time. Exhaustion of system resources, data corruption, and numerical error accumulation are the primary symptoms of this degradation, which may eventually lead to performance degradation of the software, crash/hang failure, or other undesirable effects. &#x201C;Software rejuvenation&#x201D; is a proactive technique intended to reduce the probability of future unplanned outages due to aging. The basic idea is to pause or halt the running software, refresh its internal state, and resume or restart it. Software rejuvenation can be performed by relying on a variety of indicators of aging, or on the time elapsed since the last rejuvenation. In response to the strong desire of customers to be provided with advance notice of unplanned outages, our group has developed techniques that dete ct the occurrence of software aging due to resource exhaustion, estimate the time remaining until the exhaustion reaches a critical level, and automatically perform proactive software rejuvenation of an application, process group, or entire operating system, depending on the pervasiveness of the resource exhaustion and our ability to pinpoint the source. This technology has been incorporated into the IBM Director for xSeries servers. To quantitatively evaluate the impact of different rejuvenation policies on the availability of cluster systems, we have developed analytical models based on stochastic reward nets (SRNs). For time-based rejuvenation policies, we determined the optimal rejuvenation interval based on system availability and cost. We also analyzed a rejuvenation policy based on prediction, and showed that it can further increase system availability and reduce downtime cost. These models are very general and can capture a multitude of cluster system characteristics, failure behavior, and performabil ity measures, which we are just beginning to explore.",

Our work proposes an approach to extract temporal patterns from data to predict the occurrence of target events, such as computer attacks on host networks, or fraudulent transactions in financial institutions. Our problem formulation exhibits two major challenges: 1) we assume events being characterized by categorical features and displaying uneven inter-arrival times; such an assumption falls outside the scope of classical time-series analysis, 2) we assume target events are highly infrequent; predictive techniques must deal with the class-imbalance problem. We propose an efficient algorithm that tackles the challenges above by transforming the event prediction problem into a search for all frequent eventsets preceding target events. The class imbalance problem is overcome by a search for patterns on the minority class exclusively; the discrimination power of patterns is then validated against other classes. Patterns are then combined into a rule-based model for prediction. Our experimental analysis indicates the types of event sequences where target events can be accurately predicted.",

            "abstract" : "The growing computational and storage needs of several scientific applications mandate the deployment of extreme-scale parallel machines, such as IBMs BlueGene/L which can accommodate as many as 128 K processors. One of the challenges when designing and deploying these systems in a production setting is the need to take failure occurrences, whether it be in the hardware or in the software, into account. Earlier work has shown that conventional runtime fault-tolerant techniques such as periodic checkpointing are not effective to the emerging systems. Instead, the ability to predict failure occurrences can help develop more effective checkpointing strategies. Failure prediction has long been regarded as a challenging research problem, mainly due to the lack of realistic failure data from actual production systems. In this study, we have collected RAS event logs from BlueGene/L over a period of more than 100 days. We have investigated the characteristics of fatal failure events, as well as the correlation between fatal events and non-fatal events. Based on the observations, we have developed three simple yet effective failure prediction methods, which can predict around 80% of the memory and network failures, and 47% of the application I/O failures",

            "abstract" : "The demand for more computational power in science and engineering has spurred the design and deployment of ever-growing cluster systems. Even though the individual components used in these systems are highly reliable, the presence of large number of components inevitably increases the failure probability of such systems. Successful prediction of potential failures can greatly enhance various fault tolerance mechanisms used in large clusters, thereby mitigating the adverse impact of failures on system productivity and total cost of ownership. In this paper, we present a three-phase failure predictor to automatically process RAS events and further discover failure patterns for prediction in Blue Gene/L systems. In particular, this paper explores the use of meta- learning to adoptively integrate base methods with the goal to boost prediction accuracy. Experiments with two RAS logs collected from Blue Gene/L systems at ANL and SDSC demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed failure predictor.",

            "abstract" : "If we hope to automatically detect and diagnose failures in large-scale computer systems, we must study real deployed systems and the data they generate. Progress has been hampered by the inaccessibility of empirical data. This paper addresses that dearth by examining system logs from five supercomputers, with the aim of providing useful insight and direction for future research into the use of such logs. We present details about the systems, methods of log collection, and how alerts were identified; propose a simpler and more effective filtering algorithm; and define operational context to encompass the crucial information that we found to be currently missing from most logs. The machines we consider (and the number of processors) are: Blue Gene/L (131072), Red Storm (10880), Thunderbird (9024), Spirit (1028), and Liberty (512). This is the first study of raw system logs from multiple supercomputers.",

            "abstract" : "The running times of many computational science applications are much longer than the mean-time-to-failure of current high-performance computing platforms. To run to completion, such applications must tolerate hardware failures. Checkpoint-and-restart (CPR) is the most commonly used scheme for accomplishing this - the state of the computation is saved periodically on stable storage, and when a hardware failure is detected, the computation is restarted from the most recently saved state. Most automatic CPR schemes in the literature can be classified as system-level checkpointing schemes because they take core-dump style snapshots of the computational state when all the processes are blocked at global barriers in the program. Unfortunately, a system that implements this style of checkpointing is tied to a particular platform; in addition, it cannot be used if there are no global barriers in the program. We are exploring an alternative called application-level, non-blocking checkpointing. In our approach, programs are transformed by a pre-processor so that they become self-checkpointing and self-restartable on any platform; there is also no assumption about the existence of global barriers in the code. In this paper, we describe our implementation of application-level, non-blocking checkpointing. We present experimental results on both a Windows cluster and a Compaq Alpha cluster, which show that the overheads introduced by our approach are small.",

This weakness prevents migrationbased proactive fault tolerance, among others, to be applied to MPI applications. In this study, we propose distributed migration protocols with group membership management to support process migration with group changing. We design and implement a process migration enabling MPI library, named MPIMitten, to verify the protocols and enhance current MPI platforms for reliability and usability. MPI-Mitten is based on MPI standard and can be applied to any MPI-2 implementations. Experimental results show the proposed distributed process migration protocols are solid and the MPI-Mitten system is effective and is uniquely supporting migration-based fault tolerance.",

            "title" : "A Job Pause Service under LAM/MPI+BLCR for Transparent Fault Tolerance",
            "abstract" : "Checkpoint/restart (C/R) has become a requirement for long-running jobs in large-scale clusters due to a meantime-to-failure (MTTF) in the order of hours. After a failure, C/R mechanisms generally require a complete restart of an MPI job from the last checkpoint. A complete restart, however, is unnecessary since all but one node is typically still alive. Furthermore, a restart may result in lengthy job requeuing even though the original job had not exceeded its time quantum. In this paper, we overcome these shortcomings. Instead of job restart, we have developed a transparent mechanism for job pause within LAM/MPI+BLCR. This mechanism allows live nodes to remain active and roll back to the last checkpoint while failed nodes are dynamically replaced by spares before resuming from the last checkpoint. Our methodology includes LAM/MPI enhancements in support of scalable group communication with fluctuating number of nodes, reuse of network connections, transparent coordinated checkpoint scheduling and a BLCR enhancement for job pause. Experiments in a cluster with the NAS parallel benchmark suite show that our overhead for job pause is comparable to that of a complete job restart. A minimal overhead of 5.6% is only incurred in case migration takes place while the regular checkpoint overhead remains unchanged. Yet, our approach alleviates the need to reboot the LAM run-time environment, which accounts for considerable overhead resulting in net savings of our scheme in the experiments. Our solution further provides full transparency and automation with the additional benefit of reusing existing resources. Executing continues after failures within the scheduled job, i.e., the application staging overhead is not incurred again in contrast to a restart. Our scheme offers additional potential for savings through incremental checkpointing and proactive diskless live migration, which we are currently working on.",

For these problems, we apply the approximation methods based on the variational principle and develop the computation algorithms to derive the optimal checkpoint sequence approximately. Next, we focus on the situation where the knowledge on system failure is incomplete, i.e. the system failure time distribution is unknown. We develop the so-called min-max checkpoint placement methods to determine the optimal checkpoint sequence under the uncertain circumstance in terms of the system failure time distribution. In numerical examples, we investigate quantitatively the min-max checkpoint placement methods, and refer to their potential applicability in practice.",

In such systems, fault tolerance is critical as failures will occur very often. Checkpointing and rollback recovery has been extensively studied as an attempt to provide fault tolerance. However, current implementations do not provide the total transparency and full flexibility that are necessary to support the new paradigm of autonomic computing - systems able to self-heal and self-repair. We provide an in-depth evaluation of incremental checkpointing for scientific computing. The experimental results, obtained on a state-of-the art cluster running several scientific applications, show that efficient, scalable, automatic and user-transparent incremental checkpointing is within reach with current technology.",

            "abstract" : "Diskless Checkpointing is a technique for checkpointing the state of a long-running computation on a distributed system without relying on stable storage. As such, it eliminates the performance bottleneck of traditional checkpointing on distributed systems. In this paper, we motivate diskless checkpointing and present the basic diskless checkpointing scheme along with several variants for improved performance. The performance of the basic scheme and its variants is evaluated on a high-performance network of workstations and compared to traditional disk-based checkpointing. We conclude that diskless checkpointing is a desirable alternative to disk-based checkpointing that can improve the performance of distributed applications in the face of failures.",

            "abstract" : "As high performance clusters continue to grow in size, the mean time between failures shrinks. Thus, the issues of fault tolerance and reliability are becoming one of the challenging factors for application scalability. The traditional disk-based method of dealing with faults is to checkpoint the state of the entire application periodically to reliable storage and restart from the recent checkpoint. The recovery of the application from faults involves (often manually) restarting applications on all processors and having it read the data from disks on all processors. The restart can therefore take minutes after it has been initiated. Such a strategy requires that the failed processor can be replaced so that the number of processors at checkpoint-time and recovery-time are the same. We present FTC-Charms ++, a fault-tolerant runtime based on a scheme for fast and scalable in-memory checkpoint and restart. At restart, when there is no extra processor, the program can continue to run on the remaining processors while minimizing the performance penalty due to losing processors. The method is useful for applications whose memory footprint is small at the checkpoint state, while a variation of this scheme - in-disk checkpoint/restart can be applied to applications with large memory footprint. The scheme does not require any individual component to be fault-free. We have implemented this scheme for Charms++ and AMPI (an adaptive version of MPl). This work describes the scheme and shows performance data on a cluster using 128 processors.",

From the host interface, error correction code, disk sequencer, microprocessor(s), servo control logic, buffer controller, to the embedded memory, the HDC has become a true system on a chip. Depending on the product, embedded DRAM is used as buffering for data between the host and media and possibly for storing controller firmware. By bringing all these blocks into one chip, pin counts can be reduced and higher data flow speeds can be obtained by decreasing the interconnect delays. However, the challenge for designers is in test and verification of the design during development and production.",

            "abstract" : "Software systems are known to suffer from outages due to transient errors. Recently, the phenomenon of software aging, in which the state of the software system degrades with time, has been reported (S. Garg et al., 1998). The primary causes of this degradation are the exhaustion of operating system resources, data corruption and numerical error accumulation. This may eventually lead to performance degradation of the software or crash/hang failure, or both. Earlier work in this area to detect aging and to estimate its effect on system resources did not take into account the system workload. In this paper, we propose a measurement-based model to estimate the rate of exhaustion of operating system resources both as a function of time and the system workload state. A semi-Markov reward model is constructed based on workload and resource usage data collected from the UNIX operating system. We first identify different workload states using statistical cluster analysis and build a state-space model. Corresponding to each resource, a reward function is then defined for the model based on the rate of resource exhaustion in the different states. The model is then solved to obtain trends and the estimated exhaustion rates and the time-to-exhaustion for the resources. With the help of this measure, proactive fault management techniques such as software rejuvenation (Y. Huang et al., 1995) may be employed to prevent unexpected outages.",

We evaluate the effectiveness of a previously developed job scheduling algorithm for BlueGene/L in the presence of faults. We have developed two new job-scheduling algorithms considering failures while scheduling the jobs. We have also evaluated the impact of these algorithms on average bounded slowdown, average response time and system utilization, considering different levels of proactive failure prediction and prevention techniques reported in the literature. Our simulation studies show that the use of these new algorithms with even trivial fault prediction confidence or accuracy levels (as low as 10%) can significantly improve the performance of the BlueGene/L system.",

            "abstract" : "A critical problem facing by managing large-scale clusters is to identify the location of problems in a system in case of unusual events. As the scale of high performance computing (HPC) grows, systems are getting bigger. When a system fails to function properly, health-related data are collected for troubleshooting. However, due to the massive quantities of information obtained from a large number of components, the root causes of anomalies are often buried like needles in a haystack. In this paper, we present a localization method to automatically find out the potential root causes (i.e. a subset of nodes) of the problem from the overwhelming amount of data collected system-wide. System managers can focus on examining these potential locations, thereby significantly reducing human efforts required for anomaly localization. Our method consists of three interrelated steps: (1) feature collection to assemble a feature space for the system; (2) feature extraction to obtain the most significant features for efficient data analysis by applying the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm; and (3) outlier detection to quickly identify the nodes that are ldquofar awayrdquo from the majority by using the cell-based detection algorithm. Preliminary studies are presented to demonstrate the potential of our method for localizing anomalies in a computing environment where the nodes perform comparable tasks.",

To address this issue, checkpointing/restart is widely used to provide the basic fault-tolerant functionality, yet it suffers from high overhead and its reactive characteristic. In this work, we propose FT-Pro, an adaptive fault management mechanism that optimally chooses migration, checkpointing or no action to reduce the application execution time in the presence of failures based on the failure prediction. A cost-based evaluation model is presented for dynamic decision at run-time. Using the actual failure log from a production cluster at NCSA, we demonstrate that even with modest failure prediction accuracy, FT-Pro outperforms the traditional checkpointing/restart strategy by 13%-30% in terms of reducing the application execution time despite failures, which is a significant performance improvement for long-running applications.",

            "abstract" : "Cooperative checkpointing uses global knowledge of the state and health of the machine to improve performance and reliability by dynamically deciding when to skip checkpoint requests made by applications. Using results from cooperative checkpointing theory, this paper proves that periodic checkpointing is not expected to be competitive with the offline optimal. By leveraging probabilistic information about the future, cooperative checkpointing gives flexible algorithms that are optimally competitive. The results prove that simulating periodic checkpointing; by performing only every dth checkpoint, is not competitive with the offline optimal in the worst case; a simple modification gives a provably competitive algorithm. Calculations using failure traces from a prototype of IBMs Blue Gene/L show an application using cooperative checkpointing may make progress 4 times faster than one using periodic checkpointing, under realistic conditions. We contribute an approach to providing large-scale system reliability through cooperative checkpointing and techniques for analyzing the approach",

            "abstract" : "Current supercomputing systems consisting of thousands of nodes cannot meet the demands of emerging high-performance scientific applications. As a result, a new generation of supercomputing systems consisting of hundreds of thousands of nodes is being proposed. However, these systems are likely to experience far more frequent failures than todays systems, and such failures must be tackled effectively. Coordinated checkpointing is a common technique to deal with failures in supercomputers. This paper presents a model of a coordinated checkpointing protocol for large-scale supercomputers, and studies its scalability by considering both the coordination overhead and the effect of failures. Unlike most of the existing checkpointing models, the proposed model takes into account failures during checkpointing and recovery, as well as correlated failures. Stochastic activity networks (SANs) are used to model the system, and the model is simulated to study the scalability, reliability, and performance of the system.",

Our parallel implementation places no limit on the depth or complexity of the adaptive grid hierarchy, allowing us to achieve unprecedented spatial and temporal dynamic range. We report on a simulation of primordial star formation which develops over 8000 subgrids at 34 levels of re.nement to achieve a local refinement of a factor of 1012 in space and time. This allows us to resolve the properties of the first stars which form in the universe assuming standard physics and a standard cosmological model. Achieving extreme resolution requires the use of 128-bit extended precision arithmetic (EPA) to accurately specify the subgrid positions. We describe our EPA AMR implementation on the IBM SP2 Blue Horizon system at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.",

            "abstract" : "Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) is a type of multiscale algorithm that achieves high resolution in localized regions of dynamic, multidimensional numerical simulations. One of the key issues related to AMR is dynamic load balancing (DLB), which allows large-scale adaptive applications to run efficiently on parallel systems. In this paper we present an efficient DLB scheme for structured AMR (SAMR) applications. Our DLB scheme combines a grid-splitting technique with direct grid movements (e.g., direct movement from an overloaded processor to an underloaded proces sor), for which the objective is to efficiently redistribute workload among all the processors so as to reduce the parallel execution time. The potential benefits of our DLB scheme are examined by incorporating our techniques into a parallel, cosmological application that uses SAMR techniques. Experiments show that by using our scheme, the parallel execution time can be reduced by up to 47% and the quality of load-balancing can be improved by a factor of four.",

To this end a pilot program called the International Virtual Design Studio (IVDS) was undertaken jointly by the departments of mechanical engineering at Union College in Schenectady, NY and the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey, wherein students from each institution are joined as a team to pursue their senior design projects across international boundaries and culture differences. Using a combination of interactive video and Internet communications, the two parts of the team undertook a single design and build project, sharing databases and designs electronically, communicating both by e-mail and in real time through periodic video conferencing, and building their respective portions of the final design at the individual institutions. The team members met each other in person at the end of the project when they came together in Ankara to assemble the final design and participate in the design competition with the remaining teams from METU. The IVDS provides students with a real-world design experience, international cultural interaction, and team building and project management experience. The success of this program has led to plans to expand it to include other disciplines and additional universities throughout the world.",

            "abstract" : "The paper discusses mobile robot localization by means of geometric features from a laser range finder and a CCD camera. The features are line segments from the laser scanner and vertical edges from the camera. Emphasis is put on sensor models with a strong physical basis. For both sensors, uncertainties in the calibration and measurement process are adequately modeled and propagated through the feature extractors. This yields observations with their first order covariance estimates which are passed to an extended Kalman filter for fusion and position estimation. Experiments on a real platform show that, opposed to the use of the laser range finder only, the multisensor setup allows the uncertainty to stay bounded in difficult localization situations like long corridors, and contributes to an important reduction of uncertainty, particularly in the orientation. The experiments further demonstrate the applicability of such a multisensor localization system in real time on a fully autonomous robot.",

An integrated control system has disparate and spatially distributed subsystems interconnected via a common communication channel. Digital data from sensor to controller and from controller to actuator are multiplexed along with traffic from other control loops and management functions. The asynchronous time-division multiplexing introduces time-varying and possibly stochastic delays in the control loops, degrading system dynamic performance. The analysis of delayed control systems is treated, covering the stochastic Lyapunov method approach, the D-partition method, and the method of steps.",

            "abstract" : "The application of an input precompensation scheme for vibration suppression in slewing flexible structures, with particular application to flexible-link robotic manipulator systems, is considered. The control from such input shaping schemes corresponds to a feedforward term that convolves in real time the desired reference input with a sequence of impulses and produces a vibration-free output. The robustness of such an algorithm with respect to modal frequency variations is not satisfactory but can be improved by convolving the input with a longer sequence of impulses, the tradeoff being a decrease in the transient response speed. An adaptive precompensation scheme that can be implemented by combining a frequency domain identification scheme, used to estimate the modal frequencies online, with a subsequent scheme for adjusting the spacing between the impulses is proposed. The combined adaptive input shaping scheme provides the most rapid slew that results in a vibration-free output. Experimental results for a single flexible link are presented to verify the technique.",

            "abstract" : "This paper presents a design and implementation case study that focuses on endpoint position control of a two degree-of-freedom robot with very flexible links. Linear and nonlinear conventional control techniques have been shown to be somewhat successful in achieving various control objectives for the laboratory test beds of this and many other studies; however, their reliance on an accurate mathematical model of the process often limits their chances of achieving good endpoint position control. Here the authors investigate an alternative to conventional approaches where they employ rule-based controllers to represent and implement two general forms of knowledge that they have about how to best control the mechanism: i) experience gained from the use of a mathematical model and conventional control; and ii) an intuitive understanding of the dynamics of the two-link flexible robot. The authors begin the case study by assuming that the controls for the two links of the robotic mechanism can be designed and implemented independently and investigate the performance of rule-based fuzzy controllers which only use simple intuitive knowledge about how to control two independent links. Next, the authors show that if the rule-base is augmented with knowledge about the coupling effects between the two links, the controller can achieve improved performance over the uncoupled case. The final portion of the case study, which represents the authors primary contribution, investigates the use of a two-level hierarchical rule-based controller with a simple upper-level expert controller that captures knowledge about how to supervise the application of low-level fuzzy controllers during movements in the robot workspace. Overall, the rule-based supervisory control results have proven to be extremely effective for vibration suppression in the laboratory test bed of this study, comparing favorably (in terms of performance, design complexity, and implementation issues) to a variety of conventional techniques attempted to date (including linear robust designs, feedback linearization, input command shaping, and adaptive approaches).",
